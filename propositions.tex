\begin{enumerate}

\item Proposition 1.
\item Proposition 2.
\item The only way to significantly slow down man-made climate change is a long-lasting global economic recession.
\item Academic research would greatly benefit from outsourcing tasks like programming and facility management to dedicated personnel, instead of self-taught graduate students.
\item Instead of writing lengthy manuscripts, jupyter notebooks should be the preferred format of publications in the physical sciences.
\item Researchers who do not publish all of the raw data, measurement and analysis scripts, as well as fabrication and measurement setup details accompagnying their papers and theses, openly accessible, actively slow down scientific research.
\item Cleanroom fabrication should play an equally important role in publishable work as simulations and theory.
\item A lack of closely followed standards and practices in research (as compared to company guidlines) can severely hamper scientific progress.
\item Every PhD student should be assigned one postdoc for the first two years of their project.
\item While the Dutch train system may be equipped for daily commute, it is completely incapable of handling long distance travel.
