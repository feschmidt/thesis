# General notes

## Compiling

What's the best engine to compile with? `pdflatex` works fine; I'm having trouble with `xelatex` on mac. Does `lualatex` work?

## Layout

* I prefer to have chapter titles, numbers and figure captions in sans serif, and main body in serif

## Fonts

* I don't like the TUDelft font choice.
* Potentially better suited alternatives are
  * _Linux Biolinum + Libertine_: open source fonts and much less used supposedly.
  * _Fira Sans_: Matches with my preferred presentation style. Drawback: It's an all-sans serif font...
  * Links on this:
  * Noto Sans + Noto Serif. Open question math?
  * alternative sans serif: Roboto, Noto Sans, PT Sans
