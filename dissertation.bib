  abstract = {Electron surface states in solids are typically confined to the outermost atomic layers and, due to surface disorder, have negligible impact on electronic transport. Here, we demonstrate a very different behavior for surface states in graphene. We probe the wavelike character of these states by Fabry\textendash{}Perot (FP) interferometry and find that, in contrast to theoretical predictions, these states can propagate ballistically over micron-scale distances. This is achieved by embedding a graphene resonator formed by gate-defined p\textendash{}n junctions within a graphene superconductor\textendash{}normal\textendash{}superconductor structure. By combining superconducting Aharanov\textendash{}Bohm interferometry with Fourier methods, we visualize spatially resolved current flow and image FP resonances due to p\textendash{}n\textendash{}p cavity modes. The coherence of the standing-wave edge states is revealed by observing a new family of FP resonances, which coexist with the bulk resonances. The edge resonances have periodicity distinct from that of the bulk states manifest in a repeated spatial redistribution of current on and off the FP resonances. This behavior is accompanied by a modulation of the multiple Andreev reflection amplitude on-and-off resonance, indicating that electrons propagate ballistically in a fully coherent fashion. These results, which were not anticipated by theory, provide a practical route to developing electron analog of optical FP resonators at the graphene edge.},

By comparing these results with the standard Dirac-BdG method, where rigid boundary conditions are assumed at the S{$\mid$}N interfaces, we show on a crucial importance of both proximity effect and depairing by current for the CPR. The proximity effect grows with temperature and reduces the skewness of the CPR toward the harmonic result. In short junctions (L{$<\xi$}) current depairing is also important and gives rise to a critical phase {$\phi$}c{$<\pi$}/2 over a wide range of temperatures and doping levels.},

The effect, which is the analog of optical bistability, manifests itself in the transmission and reflection characteristics of the cavity and is governed by a competition between the wave amplitude dependence of the resonant frequency and the finite residence time of the field energy inside the cavity. This finite residence time is solely due to extraction of radiation from the cavity by the measurement process. The tight quantitative agreement with a simple model based on the Duffing oscillator equation shows that the nonlinearity, and hence the bifurcation phenomenon, is solely dispersive.},

Although this type of interaction is an extremely versatile resource and not limited to coupling light fields to mechanical resonators, there have only been, very few reports of implementing it within other systems so far. Here, we present a device consisting of two superconducting LC circuits, parametrically coupled to each other by a magnetic flux-tunable photon-pressure interaction. We observe dynamical backaction between the two circuits, photon-pressure-induced transparency and absorption, and enter the parametric strong-coupling regime, enabling switchable and controllable coherent state transfer between the two modes. As result of the parametric interaction, we are also able to amplify and observe thermal current fluctuations in a radio-frequency LC circuit close to its quantum ground-state. Due to the high design flexibility and precision of superconducting circuits and the large single-photon coupling rate, our approach will enable new ways to control and detect radio-frequency photons and allow for experiments in parameter regimes not accessible to other platforms with photon-pressure interaction.},

So far, these studies have been limited to the case of diffusive transport through graphene with poorly defined and modest-quality graphene/superconductor interfaces, usually combined with small critical magnetic fields of the superconducting electrodes. Here, we report graphene-based Josephson junctions with one-dimensional edge contacts19 of molybdenum rhenium. The contacts exhibit a well-defined, transparent interface to the graphene, have a critical magnetic field of 8 T at 4 K, and the graphene has a high quality due to its encapsulation in hexagonal boron nitride19,20. This allows us to study and exploit graphene Josephson junctions in a new regime, characterized by ballistic transport. We find that the critical current oscillates with the carrier density due to phase-coherent interference of the electrons and holes that carry the supercurrent caused by the formation of a Fabry\textendash{}P{\'e}rot cavity. Furthermore, relatively large supercurrents are observed over unprecedented long distances of up to 1.5 {$\mu$}m. Finally, in the quantum Hall regime we observe broken symmetry states while the contacts remain superconducting. These achievements open up new avenues to exploit the Dirac nature of graphene in interaction with the superconducting state.},

  abstract = {The coherent tunnelling of Cooper pairs across Josephson junctions (JJs) generates a nonlinear inductance that is used extensively in quantum information processors based on superconducting circuits, from setting qubit transition frequencies and interqubit coupling strengths, to the gain of parametric amplifiers for quantum-limited readout. The inductance is either set by tailoring the metal-oxide dimensions of single JJs, or magnetically tuned by parallelizing multiple JJs in superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) with local current-biased flux lines. JJs based on superconductor-semiconductor hybrids represent a tantalizing all-electric alternative. The gatemon is a recently developed transmon variant which employs locally gated nanowire (NW) superconductor-semiconductor JJs for qubit control. Here, we go beyond proof-of-concept and demonstrate that semiconducting channels etched from a wafer-scale two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) are a suitable platform for building a scalable gatemon-based quantum computer. We show 2DEG gatemons meet the requirements by performing voltage-controlled single qubit rotations and two-qubit swap operations. We measure qubit coherence times up to \textasciitilde{}2 us, limited by dielectric loss in the 2DEG host substrate.},

  author = {{Castellanos-Beltran}, Manuel Angel},

  abstract = {Recent innovations in the technology of superconducting circuits have made it possible to create nonclassical states of microwave light fields. These states are usually associated with the subject of quantum optics. The ability to manipulate quantum states of microwave light fields holds out the promise of building dense integrable circuits to process quantum information electrically. However, a major difficulty lies in the fact that there is no general purpose method of efficiently measuring the quantum state of a microwave field. In this thesis, I describe the development of an amplifier, based on a Josephson parametric amplifier. This new parametric amplifier enables this kind of efficient measurement. Although parametric amplifiers are narrowband (only amplifying signals in a narrow frequency range around a central frequency), I have developed an amplifier whose central frequency is widely tunable (a full octave, 4--8 GHz), greatly improving its usefulness. I have studied the gain, bandwidth, dynamic range, and added noise of the amplifier. I have shown that when operated in a particular manner, known as degenerate mode, the parametric amplifier adds less noise than the noise associated with the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic vacuum. In addition, its gain is large enough to ensure that the amplified vacuum noise overwhelms the noise added by conventional amplifiers that follow the parametric amplifier. Together, these two features make it possible to measure either the phase or amplitude of a microwave signal where the dominant uncertainty comes from the quantum noise of the signal itself. In addition, a degenerate parametric amplifier also prepares particular nonclassical states called squeezed states. Our parametric amplifier prepares squeezed states, which have (in one of its quadratures) noise with a variance less than one tenth that of the vacuum noise. I have employed the parametric amplifier in two experiments that require its ability to make efficient measurements. First, I used the parametric amplifier to determine the full density matrix of a squeezed state generated by a second parametric amplifier. Second, I used the amplifier to enable a measurement of position with precision better than the value at the standard quantum limit. These demonstrations are powerful evidence that we have indeed realized a general-purpose quantum-efficient method of measuring microwave fields.},

Moreover, controlling the positioning of two-dimensional crystals facilitates their integration in complex devices, which enables the exploration of novel applications and the discovery of new phenomena in these materials. To date, deterministic transfer methods rely on the use of sacrificial polymer layers and wet chemistry to some extent. Here, we develop an all-dry transfer method that relies on viscoelastic stamps and does not employ any wet chemistry step. This is found to be very advantageous to freely suspend these materials as there are no capillary forces involved in the process. Moreover, the whole fabrication process is quick, efficient, clean and it can be performed with high yield.},

Potential explanations for such behaviour include short-range disorder7, 8, 9, 10, 'ripples' in graphene's atomic structure11, 12 and the presence of charged impurities7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. Here, we conduct a systematic study of the last of these mechanisms, by monitoring changes in electronic characteristics of initially clean graphene19 as the density of charged impurities (nimp) is increased by depositing potassium atoms onto its surface in ultrahigh vacuum. At non-zero carrier density, charged-impurity scattering produces the widely observed linear dependence1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 of (n). More significantly, we find that min occurs not at the carrier density that neutralizes nimp, but rather the carrier density at which the average impurity potential is zero15. As nimp increases, min initially falls to a minimum value near 4e2/h. This indicates that min in the present experimental samples1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 is governed not by the physics of the Dirac point singularity20, 21, but rather by carrier-density inhomogeneities induced by the potential of charged impurities6, 8, 14, 15.},

The bipolar Josephson junctions of graphene also show fully gate-driven macroscopic quantum tunnelling behaviour of Josephson phase particles in a potential well, where the confinement energy is gate tuneable. We suggest that the supercurrent OFF state is mainly caused by a supercurrent dephasing mechanism due to a random pseudomagnetic field generated by ripples in graphene, in sharp contrast to other nanohybrid Josephson junctions. Our study may pave the way for the development of new gate-tuneable superconducting quantum information devices.},

  abstract = {Graphene devices on standard SiO(2) substrates are highly disordered, exhibiting characteristics that are far inferior to the expected intrinsic properties of graphene. Although suspending the graphene above the substrate leads to a substantial improvement in device quality, this geometry imposes severe limitations on device architecture and functionality. There is a growing need, therefore, to identify dielectrics that allow a substrate-supported geometry while retaining the quality achieved with a suspended sample. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an appealing substrate, because it has an atomically smooth surface that is relatively free of dangling bonds and charge traps. It also has a lattice constant similar to that of graphite, and has large optical phonon modes and a large electrical bandgap. Here we report the fabrication and characterization of high-quality exfoliated mono- and bilayer graphene devices on single-crystal h-BN substrates, by using a mechanical transfer process. Graphene devices on h-BN substrates have mobilities and carrier inhomogeneities that are almost an order of magnitude better than devices on SiO(2). These devices also show reduced roughness, intrinsic doping and chemical reactivity. The ability to assemble crystalline layered materials in a controlled way permits the fabrication of graphene devices on other promising dielectrics and allows for the realization of more complex graphene heterostructures.},

We have explored the local microscopic properties of graphene on a BN substrate using scanning tunneling microscopy. We find that BN substrates result in extraordinarily flat graphene layers that display microscopic Moir{\'e} patterns arising from the relative orientation of the graphene and BN lattices. Gate-dependent dI/dV spectra of graphene on BN exhibit spectroscopic features that are sharper than those obtained for graphene on SiO2. We observe a significant reduction in local microscopic charge inhomogeneity for graphene on BN compared to graphene on SiO2.},

In preparation for the movie, the script writers, Al Reinart and Bill Broyles, came down to Clear Lake to interview me on "What are the people in Mission Control really like?" One of their questions was "Weren't there times when everybody, or at least a few people, just panicked?" My answer was "No, when bad things happened, we just calmly laid out all the options, and failure was not one of them." ... I immediately sensed that Bill Broyles wanted to leave and assumed that he was bored with the interview. Only months later did I learn that when they got in their car to leave, he started screaming, "That's it! That's the tag line for the whole movie, Failure is not an option.},

  abstract = {Going quantum with radio waves
It becomes increasingly difficult to detect long-wavelength single photons because of thermal fluctuations in the background. This can pose problems for single-photon detection for fields such as astronomy and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. Gely et al. used a superconducting qubit, initially developed for circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) and quantum information processing for microwaves, to directly observe the quantization of radio-frequency electromagnetic fields stored in a photonic microresonator. They were then able to manipulate the quantum state of the radio-frequency field, forming one- and two-photon Fock states within the microresonator, and analyze how the system interacts dynamically with its environment. The cQED approach could be used for fundamental studies in quantum thermodynamics and also find practical application in imaging.
Science, this issue p. 1072
Detecting weak radio-frequency electromagnetic fields plays a crucial role in a wide range of fields, from radio astronomy to nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. In quantum optics, the ultimate limit of a weak field is a single photon. Detecting and manipulating single photons at megahertz frequencies presents a challenge because, even at cryogenic temperatures, thermal fluctuations are appreciable. Using a gigahertz superconducting qubit, we observed the quantization of a megahertz radio-frequency resonator, cooled it to the ground state, and stabilized Fock states. Releasing the resonator from our control, we observed its rethermalization with nanosecond resolution. Extending circuit quantum electrodynamics to the megahertz regime, we have enabled the exploration of thermodynamics at the quantum scale and allowed interfacing quantum circuits with megahertz systems such as spin systems or macroscopic mechanical oscillators.

When contacted with two superconducting electrodes, graphene can support Cooper pair transport, resulting in the well-known Josephson effect. The current\textendash{}phase relation in a ballistic graphene Josephson junction is unique, and could provide a signature for the detection of ballistic Dirac fermions. This relation can be measured experimentally either directly via incorporation of graphene in an RF superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) or indirectly via a dc-SQUID. We calculate the expected flux modulation of the switching current in the case of the dc-SQUID and compare the results to a previous experiment. Further experiments investigating the current\textendash{}phase relation in graphene are promising for the observation of ballistic Dirac fermions.},

Tunneling characteristics of the junctions have been found to deteriorate with increasing stress magnitudes, suggesting breakdown mechanisms depending on the magnitude and polarity of the applied stress or the time-duration of applied stress. The typically observed stress effects can be ascribed to a reduction in the effective barrier thickness or increase in barrier transparency, and corresponding to the formation of conduction channels through the barrier above a threshold stress current. Significant stress current polarity dependence has been observed and described.},

In Al/AlOx/Al junctions, we observed a decrease of 2 orders of magnitude in the current upon the transition from the SIS to the SIN regime, where it then matched theory. In Al/AlOx/Cu junctions, we also observed generic features of coherent diffusive Andreev transport in a junction with a homogenous barrier. We use the quasiclassical Keldysh-Green function theory to quantify single- and two-particle tunneling and find good agreement with experiment over 2 orders of magnitude in transparency. We argue that our observations rule out pinholes as the origin of the excess current.},

Defining a new simulation setup is very similar to describing the corresponding mathematical model. Kwant offers direct support for calculations of transport properties (conductance, noise, scattering matrix), dispersion relations, modes, wave functions, various Green's functions, and out-of-equilibrium local quantities. Other computations involving tight-binding Hamiltonians can be implemented easily thanks to its extensible and modular nature.

We have compared the lifetimes of phase qubits before and after removal of the isolating dielectric, SiNx, and find a fourfold improvement of the relaxation time after the removal. Together with the results from the transmon qubit and measurements on coplanar waveguide resonators, these measurements indicate that the lifetimes are limited by losses from the dielectric constituents of the qubits. We have extracted the individual loss contributions from the dielectrics in the tunnel junction barrier, AlOx, the isolating dielectric, SiNx, and the substrate, Si/SiO2, by weighting the total loss with the parts of the electric field over the different dielectric materials. Our results agree well with and complement the findings from other studies, demonstrating that superconducting qubits can be used as a reliable tool for high-frequency characterization of dielectric materials. We conclude with a discussion of how changes in design and material choice could improve qubit lifetimes by up to a factor of 4.},

Phys. 45, 4054 (1974)] and by incorporating the temperature dependence of the superconductor thermal conductivity under a linear approximation, we find a much better agreement with the observed temperature dependence of the retrapping current in short superconducting Nb-based weak links and {$\mu$}-SQUIDs. In addition, using the temperature dependence of the critical current, we find that above a certain temperature hysteresis disappears. We analyze the current-voltage characteristics and the weak link temperature variation in both the hysteretic and nonhysteretic regimes. We also discuss the effect of the weak link geometry in order to widen the temperature range of hysteresis-free operation.},

To achieve its science goals, Advanced ACTPol utilizes a larger readout multiplexing factor than any previous CMB experiment to measure detector arrays with approximately two thousand transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers in each 150 mm detector wafer. We present the implementation and testing of the Advanced ACTPol time-division multiplexing readout architecture with a 64-row multiplexing factor. This includes testing of individual multichroic detector pixels and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) multiplexing chips as well as testing and optimizing of the integrated readout electronics. In particular, we describe the new automated multiplexing SQUID tuning procedure developed to select and optimize the thousands of SQUID parameters required to readout each Advanced ACTPol array. The multichroic detector pixels in each array use separate channels for each polarization and each of the two frequencies, such that four TESes must be read out per pixel. Challenges addressed include doubling the number of detectors per multiplexed readout channel compared to ACTPol and optimizing the Nyquist inductance to minimize detector and SQUID noise aliasing.},

Superconducting-nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) comprise these two solid-state and optic aspects enabling high-rate (1.3 Gb s-1) quantum key distribution over long distances ({$>$}400 km), long-range quantum communication ({$>$}1200 km), as well as space communication (239 000 miles). The attractiveness of SNSPDs stems from competitive performance in the four single-photon relevant characteristics at wavelengths ranges from UV to the mid-IR: high detection efficiency, low false-signal rate, low uncertainty in photon time arrival, and fast reset time. However, to date, these characteristics cannot be optimized simultaneously. In this review, the mechanisms that govern these four characteristics are presented, and it is demonstrated how they are affected by material properties and device design as well as by the operating conditions, allowing aware optimization of SNSPDs.

We characterize the tunnel barrier formation and investigate the correlation of plasma characteristics and junction properties. The experiment shows that an increase in nitridation time and applied power results in an increase in junction resistance, while variation in nitrogen pressure has almost no influence on the junction characteristics. Analysing the correlation of junction resistance and plasma properties, it is concluded that the mechanism of tunnel barrier formation is based on nitrogen implantation into the Al layer with subsequent diffusion of nitrogen, stimulated by plasma heating.},

Of these three standards, only the ampere, which is the unit of electric current, is an International System of Units (SI) base unit. However, even with modern technology, relatively large uncertainty exists regarding the generation and measurement of current. As a result of various innovative techniques based on nanotechnology and novel materials, new types of junctions for quantum current generation and single-electron current sources have recently been proposed. These newly developed methods are also being used to investigate the consistency of the three quantum electrical effects, i.e. the Josephson, quantum Hall, and single-electron tunneling effects, which are also known as `the quantum metrology triangle'. This article describes recent research and related developments regarding current standards and quantum-metrology-triangle experiments.},

In particular, we consider I-V curves in which two different states of finite voltage coexist at the same dc bias: a high-voltage state that corresponds to the usual quasiparticle branch and a low-voltage state that is characterized by thermally activated phase diffusion. The observed hysteresis between the phase-diffusion and quasiparticle branches cannot be explained within the context of the simple resistively and capacitively shunted junction (RCSJ) model but is explained by extended models in which the damping increases with frequency. Frequency-dependent damping is shown to produce a qualitative change in the attractors of the noise-free system which allows the two voltage states to be simultaneously stable. This picture is confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations which accurately reproduce the experimental I-V curves of two different samples over a wide range of temperatures. In addition we develop analytic expressions for three key parameters of the I-V curve of junctions displaying hysteresis between the phase-diffusion and quasiparticle branches: the initial slope of the phase-diffusion branch, the bias level at which the junction switches from the phase-diffusion branch to the quasiparticle branch, and the bias level at which it returns to the phase-diffusion branch.},

Such magnetic fields typically rule out conventional Al-based Josephson-junction devices that have previously been used for tunable high-Q microwave resonators. The larger critical field of Nb allows microwave resonators with large field resilience to be fabricated. Here we demonstrate how constriction-type weak links, patterned in parallel into the central conductor of a Nb coplanar resonator with a neon focused ion beam, can be used to implement a frequency-tunable resonator. We study transmission through two such devices and show how they realize high-quality-factor, tunable, field-resilient devices that hold promise for future applications coupling to spin systems.},

  abstract = {We have studied the temperature dependence of escape phenomena in various underdamped Josephson junctions (JJs). The junctions had different Josephson coupling energies EJ which were relatively small, but larger than the charging energy EC. Upon increasing the temperature T, we first observe the usual cross-over between macroscopic quantum tunnelling and thermally activated (TA) behaviour at temperatures kBT {$\sim$} {$\hslash\omega$}p, where {$\omega$}p is the plasma frequency of the junction. Increasing T further, the width of the switching current distribution has, counterintuitively, a non-monotonic temperature dependence. This can be explained by the novel cross-over from TA behaviour to underdamped phase diffusion. We show that this cross-over is expected to occur at temperatures such that kBT {$\sim$} EJ(1 - 4/{$\pi$}Q)3/2, where Q is the quality factor of the junction at the plasma frequency, in agreement with experiment. Our findings can be compared with detailed model calculations which take into account dissipation and level quantization in a metastable well.Particular attention is paid to the sample with the smallest EJ, which shows extensive phase diffusion even at the lowest temperatures. This sample consists of a dc-SQUID and a single JJ close to each other, such that the SQUID acts as a tunable inductive protection for the single junction from fluctuations of a dissipative environment. By varying the flux through the dc-SQUID, we present, for the first time, experimental evidence of the escape of a JJ from the phase diffusion regime to the free running state in a tunable environment. We also show that in the zero voltage state the losses mainly occur at frequencies near the plasma resonance.},

Different approaches have been devised to cure this problem for superconducting qubits, a prime example being the operation of such devices at optimal working points, so-called ``sweet spots.'' This latter approach led to significant improvement of T2 times in Cooper pair box qubits [D. Vion et al., Science 296, 886 (2002)]. Here, we introduce a new type of superconducting qubit called the ``transmon.'' Unlike the charge qubit, the transmon is designed to operate in a regime of significantly increased ratio of Josephson energy and charging energy EJ{$\slash$}EC. The transmon benefits from the fact that its charge dispersion decreases exponentially with EJ{$\slash$}EC, while its loss in anharmonicity is described by a weak power law. As a result, we predict a drastic reduction in sensitivity to charge noise relative to the Cooper pair box and an increase in the qubit-photon coupling, while maintaining sufficient anharmonicity for selective qubit control. Our detailed analysis of the full system shows that this gain is not compromised by increased noise in other known channels.},

From the analysis of successive thermal instabilities in the transport characteristics of micron-size superconducting quantum interference devices with a well-controlled geometry, we obtain a complete picture of the different thermal regimes. These determine whether or not the junctions are hysteretic. Below the superconductor critical temperature, the critical current switches from a classical weak-link behavior to one driven by the proximity effect. The associated small amplitude of the critical current makes it robust with respect to the heat generation by phase slips, leading to a nonhysteretic behavior.},

  abstract = {TES-based bolometer and microcalorimeter arrays with thousands of pixels are under development for several space-based and ground-based applications. A linear detector response and low levels of crosstalk facilitate the calibration of the instruments. In an effort to improve the properties of TES-based detectors, fixing the TES resistance in a resistance-locked loop (RLL) under optical loading has recently been proposed. Earlier theoretical work on this mode of operation has shown that the detector speed, linearity, and dynamic range should improve with respect to voltage-biased operation. This paper presents an experimental demonstration of multiplexed readout in this mode of operation in a TES-based detector array with noise equivalent power (NEP) values of 3.5 {$\cdot$} 10-19W/{$\surd$}Hz. The measured noise and dynamic properties of the detector in the RLL will be compared with the earlier modeling work. Furthermore, the practical implementation routes for future FDM systems for the readout of bolometer and microcalorimeter arrays will be discussed.},

  abstract = {Different terrestrial terahertz applications would benefit from large-format arrays, operating in compact and inexpensive cryocoolers at liquid helium temperature with sensitivity, limited only by the 300-K background radiation. A voltage-biased transition-edge sensor (TES) as a THz detector can have sufficient sensitivity and has a number of advantages important for real applications: linearity of response, high dynamic range, and simple calibration. However, it requires a low-noise current readout. Usually, a current amplifier based on superconducting quantum-interference device (SQUID) is used for readout, but the scalability of this approach is limited due to the complexity of the operation and fabrication. Recently, it has been shown that instead of SQUID it is possible to use a current sensor, which is based on the nonlinearity of the kinetic inductance of a current-carrying superconducting stripe. Embedding the stripe into a microwave high-Q superconducting resonator allows for reaching sufficient current sensitivity. More important, it is possible with the resonator approach to scale up to large arrays using frequency-division multiplexing in GHz range. Here, we demonstrate the operation of a voltage-biased TES with a microwave kinetic-inductance current amplifier at 4.2 K. We measured the expected intrinsic noise-equivalent power 5 \texttimes{} 10-14 W/Hz1/2 and confirmed that a sufficient sensitivity of the readout can be reached in conjunction with a real TES operation. The construction of an array with the improved sensitivity 10-15 W/Hz1/2 at 4.2 K could be realized using a combination of the new current amplifier and already existing TES detectors with improved thermal isolation.},

In this paper it is shown qualitatively that quasiparticles create decoherence. We can decrease the number of quasiparticles present in the junctions by two methods - reducing the creation rate with current shunts and increasing the depletion rate with normal-metal traps. Experimental data demonstrate that both methods are required to significantly reduce the number of quasiparticles and increase the system's coherence. We conclude that these methods are effective and that the design of Josephson-junction qubits must consider the role of quasiparticles.},

To overcome the obstacles, we vertically sandwiched a cleaved graphene monoatomic layer as the normal-conducting spacer between superconducting electrodes. The atomically thin single-crystalline graphene layer serves as an ultimately short conducting channel, with highly transparent interfaces with superconductors. In particular, we show the strong Josephson coupling reaching the theoretical limit, the convex-shaped temperature dependence of the Josephson critical current and the exceptionally skewed phase dependence of the Josephson current; all demonstrate the bona fide short and ballistic Josephson nature. This vertical stacking scheme for extremely thin transparent spacers would open a new pathway for exploring the exotic coherence phenomena occurring on an atomic scale.},

In-between, the intimate connection linking terahertz sensors and terahertz sources is highlighted\textemdash{}an important aspect unfortunately often overlooked or ignored when terahertz detectors are discussed in isolation. At the centre of this topical review are the various physical mechanisms by which electromagnetic radiation of terahertz frequencies interacts with matter. The logic is to present first the underlying physical principles of detection before presenting the practical implementation in a specific device, rather than the other way around. A taxonomy of terahertz detectors is then proposed based on the underlying physical principles of detection. Following on from this classification, stateof-the-art terahertz detectors are surveyed and appraised; this overview constitutes the longest section of the review. Key detector parameters which inform applications are then presented and tabulated.

This classical-to-quantum transition in device behaviour suggests the possibility for nanometer-sized electronic elements that make use of quantum coherence1,2,7,8. Molecular electronic devices are promising candidates for realizing such device elements because the electronic motion in molecules is inherently quantum mechanical9,10 and it can be modified by well defined chemistry11,12,13.

  abstract = {We theoretically consider the observed soft gap in the proximity-induced superconducting state of semiconductor nanowires in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman spin splitting, and tunneling leads, but in the absence of any extrinsic disorder (i.e., an ideal system). We critically consider the effects of three distinct intrinsic physical mechanisms (tunnel barrier to normal leads, temperature, and dissipation) on the phenomenology of the gap softness in the differential conductance spectroscopy of the normal-superconductor junction as a function of spin splitting and chemical potential. We find that all three mechanisms individually can produce a soft gap, leading to calculated conductance spectra qualitatively mimicking experimental results. We also show through extensive numerical simulations that the phenomenology of the soft gap is intrinsically tied to the broadening and the height of the Majorana zero-mode-induced differential conductance peak above the topological quantum phase transition point with both the soft gap and the quality of the Majorana zero mode being simultaneously affected by tunnel barrier, temperature, and dissipation. We establish that the Majorana zero-mode splitting oscillations can be suppressed by temperature or dissipation (in a similar manner) but not by the tunnel barrier. Since all three mechanisms (plus disorder, not considered in the current work) are likely to be present in any realistic nanowires, discerning the effects of various mechanisms is difficult, necessitating detailed experimental data as a function of all the system parameters, some of which (e.g., dissipation, chemical potential, tunnel barrier) may not be known experimentally. While the tunneling-induced soft-gap behavior is benign with no direct adverse effect on the Majorana topological properties with the zero-bias peak remaining quantized at 2e2/h, the soft gap induced by finite temperature and/or finite dissipation is detrimental to topological properties and must be avoided as much as possible.},

  abstract = {As an emergent electronic material and model system for condensed-matter physics, graphene and its electrical transport properties have become a subject of intense focus. By performing low-temperature transport spectroscopy on single-layer and bilayer graphene, we observe ballistic propagation and quantum interference of multiply reflected waves of charges from normal electrodes and multiple Andreev reflections from superconducting electrodes, thereby realizing quantum billiards in which scattering only occurs at the boundaries. In contrast to the conductivity of conventional two-dimensional materials, graphene's conductivity at the Dirac point is geometry-dependent because of conduction via evanescent modes, approaching the theoretical value 4e2/{$\pi$}h (where e is the electron charge and h is Planck's constant) only for short and wide devices. These distinctive transport properties have important implications for understanding chaotic quantum systems and implementing nanoelectronic devices, such as ballistic transistors.},

But to date, the junctions formed between graphene and superconductors on conventional substrates have been highly disordered. Charge scattering and potential fluctuations caused by such disorder are believed to have prevented the emergence or observation of new physics. Here we propose to address this problem by forming suspended graphene\textendash{}superconductor junctions. We demonstrate the fabrication of high-quality suspended monolayer graphene\textendash{}NbN Josephson junctions with device mobility in excess of 150,000 cm2 per Vs, minimum carrier density below 1010 cm-2, and the flow of a supercurrent at critical temperatures greater than 2 K. The characteristics of our Josephson junctions are consistent with ballistic transport, with a linear dependence on the Fermi energy that reflects of linear dispersion of massless Dirac fermions.},

However, the future prospects ultimately depend upon the intrinsic coherence of Josephson junctions, and whether superconducting qubits can be adequately isolated from their environment. We introduce a new architecture for superconducting quantum circuits employing a three-dimensional resonator that suppresses qubit decoherence while maintaining sufficient coupling to the control signal. With the new architecture, we demonstrate that Josephson junction qubits are highly coherent, with T2{$\sim$}10 to 20 {$\mu$}s without the use of spin echo, and highly stable, showing no evidence for 1/f critical current noise. These results suggest that the overall quality of Josephson junctions in these qubits will allow error rates of a few 10-4, approaching the error correction threshold.},

This supercurrent is mainly transmitted by discrete entangled electron\textendash{}hole states confined to the nanotube, called Andreev bound states (ABS). These states are a key concept in mesoscopic superconductivity as they provide a universal description of Josephson-like effects in quantum-coherent nanostructures (for example molecules, nanowires, magnetic or normal metallic layers) connected to superconducting leads5. We report here the first tunnelling spectroscopy of individually resolved ABS, in a nanotube\textendash{}superconductor device. Analysing the evolution of the ABS spectrum with a gate voltage, we show that the ABS arise from the discrete electronic levels of the molecule and that they reveal detailed information about the energies of these levels, their relative spin orientation and the coupling to the leads. Such measurements hence constitute a powerful new spectroscopic technique capable of elucidating the electronic structure of CNT-based devices, including those with well-coupled leads. This is relevant for conventional applications (for example, superconducting or normal transistors, superconducting quantum interference devices3 (SQUIDs)) and quantum information processing (for example, entangled electron pair generation6,7, ABS-based qubits8). Finally, our device is a new type of d.c.-measurable SQUID.},

As a first step, we have developed an efficient computational approach to calculate the Josephson current in tight-binding systems. This approach can be particularly useful in the long-junction limit, which has hitherto attracted less theoretical interest but has recently become experimentally relevant. We use this computational approach to study the dependence of the critical current on the junction geometry, doping level, and an applied perpendicular magnetic field B. In zero magnetic field we find a good qualitative agreement with the recent experiment of M. Ben Shalom et al. [Nat. Phys. 12, 318 (2016)] for the length dependence of the critical current. For highly doped samples our numerical calculations show a broad agreement with the results of the quasiclassical formalism. In this case the critical current exhibits Fraunhofer-like oscillations as a function of B. However, for lower doping levels, where the cyclotron orbit becomes comparable to the characteristic geometrical length scales of the system, deviations from the results of the quasiclassical formalism appear. We argue that due to the exceptional tunability and long mean free path of graphene systems a new regime can be explored where geometrical and dynamical effects are equally important to understand the magnetic field dependence of the critical current.},

  abstract = {The low-energy electronic excitations in graphene are described by massless Dirac fermions that have a linear dispersion relation. Taking advantage of this `optics-like' electron dynamics, generic optical elements like lenses and wave guides have been proposed for electrons in graphene. Tuning of these elements relies on the ability to adjust the carrier concentration in defined areas. However, the combination of ballistic transport and complex gating remains challenging. Here we report on the fabrication and characterization of suspended graphene p\textendash{}n junctions. By local gating, resonant cavities can be defined, leading to complex Fabry\textendash{}P{\'e}rot interferences. The observed conductance oscillations account for quantum interference of electrons propagating ballistically over distances exceeding 1 {$\mu$}m. Visibility of the interferences is demonstrated to be enhanced by Klein collimation at the p\textendash{}n interface. This finding paves the way to more complex gate-controlled ballistic graphene devices and brings electron optics in graphene closer to reality.},

In addition, defects can spoil the induced superconductivity locally in the proximitized system, which complicates measuring global properties with a local probe. We show how to use the nonlocal conductance between two spatially separated leads to probe three global properties of a proximitized system: the bulk superconducting gap, the induced gap, and the induced coherence length. Unlike local conductance spectroscopy, nonlocal conductance measurements distinguish between nontopological zero-energy modes localized around potential inhomogeneities, and true Majorana edge modes that emerge in the topological phase. In addition, we find that the nonlocal conductance is an odd function of bias at the topological phase transition, acting as a current rectifier in the low-bias limit. More generally, we identify conditions for crossed Andreev reflection to dominate the nonlocal conductance and show how to design a Cooper pair splitter in the open regime.},

Terminating a coplanar waveguide with a nanobridge constriction Josephson junction, we observe modulation sidebands from the cavity that enable highly sensitive, frequency-multiplexed output of small currents for applications such as transition-edge sensor array readout. We derive an analytical model to reproduce the measurements over a wide range of bias currents, detunings and input powers. Tuning the frequency of the cavity by more than \textbackslash{}SI\{100\}\{\textbackslash{}mega\textbackslash{}hertz\} with DC current, our device achieves a minimum current sensitivity of \textbackslash{}SI\{8.9\}\{\textbackslash{}pico\textbackslash{}ampere\textbackslash{}per\textbackslash{}sqrt\{\textbackslash{}hertz\}\}. Extrapolating the results of our analytical model, we predict an improved device based on our platform, capable of achieving sensitivities down to \textbackslash{}SI\{50\}\{\textbackslash{}femto\textbackslash{}ampere\textbackslash{}per\textbackslash{}sqrt\{\textbackslash{}hertz\}\}\vphantom\{\}, or even lower if one could take advantage of parametric amplification in the Josephson cavity. Taking advantage of the Josephson architecture, our approach can provide higher sensitivity than kinetic inductance designs, and potentially enables detection of currents ultimately limited by quantum noise.},

Here we describe graphene junctions with a mean free path of several micrometres, low contact resistance and large supercurrents. Such devices exhibit pronounced Fabry\textendash{}P{\'e}rot oscillations not only in the normal-state resistance but also in the critical current. The proximity effect is mostly suppressed in magnetic fields below 10 mT, showing the conventional Fraunhofer pattern. Unexpectedly, some proximity survives even in fields higher than 1 T. Superconducting states randomly appear and disappear as a function of field and carrier concentration, and each of them exhibits a supercurrent carrying capacity close to the universal quantum limit17,18. We attribute the high-field Josephson effect to mesoscopic Andreev states that persist near graphene edges. Our work reveals new proximity regimes that can be controlled by quantum confinement and cyclotron motion.},

Molybdenum-Rhenium (MoRe) is a disordered superconducting alloy with a noble surface chemistry and a relatively high transition temperature. These properties make it attractive for SMR applications, but characterization of MoRe SMR has not yet been reported. Here, we present the fabrication and characterization of SMR fabricated with a MoRe 60\textendash{}40 alloy. At low drive powers, we observe internal quality-factors as high as 700 000. Temperature and power dependence of the internal quality-factors suggest the presence of the two level systems from the dielectric substrate dominating the internal loss at low temperatures. We further test the compatibility of these resonators with high temperature processes, such as for carbon nanotube chemical vapor deposition growth, and their performance in the magnetic field, an important characterization for hybrid systems.},

  abstract = {Many applications of Nb/Al-AlOx/Nb Josephson junctions (JJs) in superconducting electronics require high-quality tunnel barriers with low subgap leakage that is usually characterized by figure of merit Vm = Ic Rsg, where Ic is the critical current and Rsg is the subgap resistance at 2 mV and 4.2 K. It is widely believed, and there is considerable literature suggesting, that quality and reproducibility of JJs critically depend on the intrinsic stress in Nb/Al-AlOx/Nb trilayers, and the stress therefore should be carefully minimized and controlled. Contrary to this belief, we show that JJ quality Vm and reproducibility do not depend on the stress in the trilayer, at least in the studied range from -300 to 300 MPa. In this range, Vm depends neither on the stress in a Nb/Al base electrode nor in a Nb counter electrode. We have found, however, that Vm crucially depends on the way the tunnel barrier formation by thermal oxidation of Al is done. For instance, room-temperature dynamic oxidation (in O2 flow at low pressures) in a cryopumped chamber leads to poor run-to-run reproducibility of Vm and reduced Vm values, whereas dynamic oxidation at the same parameters but in a chamber with a turbomolecular pump results in high Vm values and excellent run-to-run reproducibility.},

The resonator consists of an interdigitated capacitor and a superconducting loop that inductively couples to the input CPW. Current running through the central line of the input CPW generates magnetic fields which are focused into the gaps of the input CPW. These magnetic fields can be measured collectively as the magnetic flux through the superconducting loop. The kinetic inductance of the superconducting loop depends on the screening current for the magnetic flux, so the input current is converted to a change in the frequency of the resonator. We analyze the response and noise of a kinetic inductance ammeter with a high-resistivity NbN loop.},

Advanced quantum simulation experiments have been shown with up to nine qubits, while a demonstration of quantum supremacy with fifty qubits is anticipated in just a few years. Quantum supremacy means that the quantum system can no longer be simulated by the most powerful classical supercomputers. Integrated classical-quantum computing systems are already emerging that can be used for software development and experimentation, even via web interfaces. Therefore, the time is ripe for describing some of the recent development of superconducting devices, systems and applications. As such, the discussion of superconducting qubits and circuits is limited to devices that are proven useful for current or near future applications. Consequently, the centre of interest is the practical applications of QIP, such as computation and simulation in Physics and Chemistry.},

Mechanical systems provide sensitive and scalable architectures for sensing applications ranging from atomic force microscopy to gravity wave interferometry. Optical resonators driven by low noise lasers provide a quiet and well-understood means to read-out and manipulate mechanical motion, by way of the radiation pressure force. Taken to an extreme, a device consisting of a high-Q nanomechanical oscillator coupled to a high-finesse optical cavity may enable ground-state preparation of the mechanical element, thus paving the way for a new class of quantum technology based on chip-scale phononic devices coupled to optical photons. By way of mutual coupling to the optical field, this architecture may enable coupling of single phonons to real or artificial atoms, an enticing prospect because of the vast ``quantum optics toolbox'' already developed for cavity quantum electrodynamics.},

The resonant frequency is tuned by applying a magnetic field perpendicular to the hole structures in the resonator's inductor wire, whose kinetic inductance is modified by wirelessly induced DC supercurrents. A continuous in situ frequency tuning of over 300 MHz is achieved for a 10 GHz resonator with a moderate magnetic field of 1.2 mT. The planar resonator design and the noncontact tuning scheme greatly ease the fabrication complexity and can be widely applied in many hybrid systems for coupling microwave modes with other forms of excitations such as optical photons, phonons, magnons, and spins.},

In the first process, devices are made using a single step of evaporation in which the resonator and the junctions of the SQUID are made at the same time. In the second process, devices are made with an identical geometry, but in which the resonators are made from a MoRe superconding layer to which an the junctions are added later in a second step. To characterize the coherence of the two types of SQUID cavities, we observe and analyze the quality factor of their resonances as a function of flux and photon number. Despite a detailed cleaning process applied during fabrication, the single-step Al devices show significantly worse quality factor than the hybrid devices, and conclude that a the hybrid technique provides a much more reliable approach for fabricating high-Q flux-tunable resonators.},

  abstract = {Ballistic Josephson junctions are predicted to support a number of exotic physics processess, providing an ideal system to inject the supercurrent in the quantum Hall regime. Herein, we demonstrate electrical transport measurements on ballistic superconductor\textendash{}graphene\textendash{}superconductor junctions by contacting graphene to niobium with a junction length up to 1.5 {$\mu$}m. Hexagonal boron nitride encapsulation and one-dimensional edge contacts guarantee high-quality graphene Josephson junctions with a mean free path of several micrometers and record-low contact resistance. Transports in normal states including the observation of Fabry\textendash{}P{\'e}rot oscillations and Sharvin resistance conclusively witness the ballistic propagation in the junctions. The critical current density JC is over one order of magnitude larger than that of the previously reported junctions. Away from the charge neutrality point, the ICRN product (IC is the critical current and RN the normal state resistance of junction) is nearly a constant, independent of carrier density n, which agrees well with the theory for ballistic Josephson junctions. Multiple Andreev reflections up to the third order are observed for the first time by measuring the differential resistance in the micrometer-long ballistic graphene Josephson junctions.},
