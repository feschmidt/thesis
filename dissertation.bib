  abstract = {Hybrid graphene\textendash{}superconductor devices have attracted much attention since the early days of graphene research1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18. So far, these studies have been limited to the case of diffusive transport through graphene with poorly defined and modest-quality graphene/superconductor interfaces, usually combined with small critical magnetic fields of the superconducting electrodes. Here, we report graphene-based Josephson junctions with one-dimensional edge contacts19 of molybdenum rhenium. The contacts exhibit a well-defined, transparent interface to the graphene, have a critical magnetic field of 8 T at 4 K, and the graphene has a high quality due to its encapsulation in hexagonal boron nitride19,20. This allows us to study and exploit graphene Josephson junctions in a new regime, characterized by ballistic transport. We find that the critical current oscillates with the carrier density due to phase-coherent interference of the electrons and holes that carry the supercurrent caused by the formation of a Fabry\textendash{}P{\'e}rot cavity. Furthermore, relatively large supercurrents are observed over unprecedented long distances of up to 1.5 {{$\mu$}}m. Finally, in the quantum Hall regime we observe broken symmetry states while the contacts remain superconducting. These achievements open up new avenues to exploit the Dirac nature of graphene in interaction with the superconducting state.},

  abstract = {We examine the nature of the transitions between the normal and the superconducting branches of superconductor-graphene-superconductor Josephson junctions.

In particular, we demonstrate that the retrapping current corresponds to the critical current at an elevated temperature, where the heating is caused by the retrapping current itself. The superconducting gap in the leads suppresses the hot electron outflow, allowing us to further study electron thermalization by phonons at low temperatures (\$T \textbackslash{}lesssim 1\$K). The relationship between the applied power and the electron temperature was found to be \$P\textbackslash{}propto T\$, which we argue is consistent with cooling due to electron-phonon interactions.},

  issn = {1530-6984},
  abstract = {Electron surface states in solids are typically confined to the outermost atomic layers and, due to surface disorder, have negligible impact on electronic transport. Here, we demonstrate a very different behavior for surface states in graphene. We probe the wavelike character of these states by Fabry\textendash{}Perot (FP) interferometry and find that, in contrast to theoretical predictions, these states can propagate ballistically over micron-scale distances. This is achieved by embedding a graphene resonator formed by gate-defined p\textendash{}n junctions within a graphene superconductor\textendash{}normal\textendash{}superconductor structure. By combining superconducting Aharanov\textendash{}Bohm interferometry with Fourier methods, we visualize spatially resolved current flow and image FP resonances due to p\textendash{}n\textendash{}p cavity modes. The coherence of the standing-wave edge states is revealed by observing a new family of FP resonances, which coexist with the bulk resonances. The edge resonances have periodicity distinct from that of the bulk states manifest in a repeated spatial redistribution of current on and off the FP resonances. This behavior is accompanied by a modulation of the multiple Andreev reflection amplitude on-and-off resonance, indicating that electrons propagate ballistically in a fully coherent fashion. These results, which were not anticipated by theory, provide a practical route to developing electron analog of optical FP resonators at the graphene edge.},

  title = {Charged-Impurity Scattering in Graphene},
  volume = {4},
  abstract = {Since the initial demonstration of the ability to experimentally isolate a single graphene sheet1, a great deal of theoretical work has focused on explaining graphene's unusual carrier-density-dependent conductivity (n), and its minimum value (min) of nearly twice the quantum unit of conductance (4e2/h) (refs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Potential explanations for such behaviour include short-range disorder7, 8, 9, 10, 'ripples' in graphene's atomic structure11, 12 and the presence of charged impurities7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. Here, we conduct a systematic study of the last of these mechanisms, by monitoring changes in electronic characteristics of initially clean graphene19 as the density of charged impurities (nimp) is increased by depositing potassium atoms onto its surface in ultrahigh vacuum. At non-zero carrier density, charged-impurity scattering produces the widely observed linear dependence1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 of (n). More significantly, we find that min occurs not at the carrier density that neutralizes nimp, but rather the carrier density at which the average impurity potential is zero15. As nimp increases, min initially falls to a minimum value near 4e2/h. This indicates that min in the present experimental samples1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 is governed not by the physics of the Dirac point singularity20, 21, but rather by carrier-density inhomogeneities induced by the potential of charged impurities6, 8, 14, 15.},

  volume = {76},
  abstract = {Short dephasing times pose one of the main challenges in realizing a quantum computer. Different approaches have been devised to cure this problem for superconducting qubits, a prime example being the operation of such devices at optimal working points, so-called ``sweet spots.'' This latter approach led to significant improvement of T2 times in Cooper pair box qubits [D. Vion et al., Science 296, 886 (2002)]. Here, we introduce a new type of superconducting qubit called the ``transmon.'' Unlike the charge qubit, the transmon is designed to operate in a regime of significantly increased ratio of Josephson energy and charging energy EJ{{$\slash$}}EC. The transmon benefits from the fact that its charge dispersion decreases exponentially with EJ{{$\slash$}}EC, while its loss in anharmonicity is described by a weak power law. As a result, we predict a drastic reduction in sensitivity to charge noise relative to the Cooper pair box and an increase in the qubit-photon coupling, while maintaining sufficient anharmonicity for selective qubit control. Our detailed analysis of the full system shows that this gain is not compromised by increased noise in other known channels.},

We characterize the tunnel barrier formation and investigate the correlation of plasma characteristics and junction properties. The experiment shows that an increase in nitridation time and applied power results in an increase in junction resistance, while variation in nitrogen pressure has almost no influence on the junction characteristics. Analysing the correlation of junction resistance and plasma properties, it is concluded that the mechanism of tunnel barrier formation is based on nitrogen implantation into the Al layer with subsequent diffusion of nitrogen, stimulated by plasma heating.},

  abstract = {Graphene devices on standard SiO(2) substrates are highly disordered, exhibiting characteristics that are far inferior to the expected intrinsic properties of graphene. Although suspending the graphene above the substrate leads to a substantial improvement in device quality, this geometry imposes severe limitations on device architecture and functionality. There is a growing need, therefore, to identify dielectrics that allow a substrate-supported geometry while retaining the quality achieved with a suspended sample. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an appealing substrate, because it has an atomically smooth surface that is relatively free of dangling bonds and charge traps. It also has a lattice constant similar to that of graphite, and has large optical phonon modes and a large electrical bandgap. Here we report the fabrication and characterization of high-quality exfoliated mono- and bilayer graphene devices on single-crystal h-BN substrates, by using a mechanical transfer process. Graphene devices on h-BN substrates have mobilities and carrier inhomogeneities that are almost an order of magnitude better than devices on SiO(2). These devices also show reduced roughness, intrinsic doping and chemical reactivity. The ability to assemble crystalline layered materials in a controlled way permits the fabrication of graphene devices on other promising dielectrics and allows for the realization of more complex graphene heterostructures.},

Taking advantage of this `optics-like' electron dynamics, generic optical elements like lenses and wave guides have been proposed for electrons in graphene. Tuning of these elements relies on the ability to adjust the carrier concentration in defined areas. However, the combination of ballistic transport and complex gating remains challenging. Here we report on the fabrication and characterization of suspended graphene p\textendash{}n junctions. By local gating, resonant cavities can be defined, leading to complex Fabry\textendash{}P{\'e}rot interferences. The observed conductance oscillations account for quantum interference of electrons propagating ballistically over distances exceeding 1 {{$\mu$}}m. Visibility of the interferences is demonstrated to be enhanced by Klein collimation at the p\textendash{}n interface. This finding paves the way to more complex gate-controlled ballistic graphene devices and brings electron optics in graphene closer to reality.},

  abstract = {In highly resistive superconducting tunnel junctions, excess subgap current is usually observed and is often attributed to microscopic pinholes in the tunnel barrier. We have studied the subgap current in superconductor\textendash{}insulator\textendash{}superconductor (SIS) and superconductor\textendash{}insulator\textendash{}normal-metal (SIN) junctions. In Al/AlOx/Al junctions, we observed a decrease of 2 orders of magnitude in the current upon the transition from the SIS to the SIN regime, where it then matched theory. In Al/AlOx/Cu junctions, we also observed generic features of coherent diffusive Andreev transport in a junction with a homogenous barrier. We use the quasiclassical Keldysh-Green function theory to quantify single- and two-particle tunneling and find good agreement with experiment over 2 orders of magnitude in transparency. We argue that our observations rule out pinholes as the origin of the excess current.},

  shorttitle = {Andreev Rectifier},
  abstract = {The proximity effect in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor structures, crucial for realizing Majorana edge modes, is complicated to control due to its dependence on many unknown microscopic parameters. In addition, defects can spoil the induced superconductivity locally in the proximitized system, which complicates measuring global properties with a local probe. We show how to use the nonlocal conductance between two spatially separated leads to probe three global properties of a proximitized system: the bulk superconducting gap, the induced gap, and the induced coherence length. Unlike local conductance spectroscopy, nonlocal conductance measurements distinguish between nontopological zero-energy modes localized around potential inhomogeneities, and true Majorana edge modes that emerge in the topological phase. In addition, we find that the nonlocal conductance is an odd function of bias at the topological phase transition, acting as a current rectifier in the low-bias limit. More generally, we identify conditions for crossed Andreev reflection to dominate the nonlocal conductance and show how to design a Cooper pair splitter in the open regime.},

  volume = {6},
  issn = {1745-2481},
  abstract = {Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are not intrinsically superconducting but they can carry a supercurrent when connected to superconducting electrodes1,2,3,4. This supercurrent is mainly transmitted by discrete entangled electron\textendash{}hole states confined to the nanotube, called Andreev bound states (ABS). These states are a key concept in mesoscopic superconductivity as they provide a universal description of Josephson-like effects in quantum-coherent nanostructures (for example molecules, nanowires, magnetic or normal metallic layers) connected to superconducting leads5. We report here the first tunnelling spectroscopy of individually resolved ABS, in a nanotube\textendash{}superconductor device. Analysing the evolution of the ABS spectrum with a gate voltage, we show that the ABS arise from the discrete electronic levels of the molecule and that they reveal detailed information about the energies of these levels, their relative spin orientation and the coupling to the leads. Such measurements hence constitute a powerful new spectroscopic technique capable of elucidating the electronic structure of CNT-based devices, including those with well-coupled leads. This is relevant for conventional applications (for example, superconducting or normal transistors, superconducting quantum interference devices3 (SQUIDs)) and quantum information processing (for example, entangled electron pair generation6,7, ABS-based qubits8). Finally, our device is a new type of d.c.-measurable SQUID.},

By comparing these results with the standard Dirac-BdG method, where rigid boundary conditions are assumed at the S{$\mid$}N interfaces, we show on a crucial importance of both proximity effect and depairing by current for the CPR. The proximity effect grows with temperature and reduces the skewness of the CPR toward the harmonic result. In short junctions (L{$<\xi$}) current depairing is also important and gives rise to a critical phase {$\phi$}c{$<\pi$}/2 over a wide range of temperatures and doping levels.},

Herein, we demonstrate electrical transport measurements on ballistic superconductor\textendash{}graphene\textendash{}superconductor junctions by contacting graphene to niobium with a junction length up to 1.5 {{$\mu$}}m. Hexagonal boron nitride encapsulation and one-dimensional edge contacts guarantee high-quality graphene Josephson junctions with a mean free path of several micrometers and record-low contact resistance. Transports in normal states including the observation of Fabry\textendash{}P{\'e}rot oscillations and Sharvin resistance conclusively witness the ballistic propagation in the junctions. The critical current density JC is over one order of magnitude larger than that of the previously reported junctions. Away from the charge neutrality point, the ICRN product (IC is the critical current and RN the normal state resistance of junction) is nearly a constant, independent of carrier density n, which agrees well with the theory for ballistic Josephson junctions. Multiple Andreev reflections up to the third order are observed for the first time by measuring the differential resistance in the micrometer-long ballistic graphene Josephson junctions.},

  abstract = {Many applications of Nb/Al-AlOx/Nb Josephson junctions (JJs) in superconducting electronics require high-quality tunnel barriers with low subgap leakage that is usually characterized by figure of merit Vm = Ic Rsg, where Ic is the critical current and Rsg is the subgap resistance at 2 mV and 4.2 K. It is widely believed, and there is considerable literature suggesting, that quality and reproducibility of JJs critically depend on the intrinsic stress in Nb/Al-AlOx/Nb trilayers, and the stress therefore should be carefully minimized and controlled. Contrary to this belief, we show that JJ quality Vm and reproducibility do not depend on the stress in the trilayer, at least in the studied range from -300 to 300 MPa. In this range, Vm depends neither on the stress in a Nb/Al base electrode nor in a Nb counter electrode. We have found, however, that Vm crucially depends on the way the tunnel barrier formation by thermal oxidation of Al is done. For instance, room-temperature dynamic oxidation (in O2 flow at low pressures) in a cryopumped chamber leads to poor run-to-run reproducibility of Vm and reduced Vm values, whereas dynamic oxidation at the same parameters but in a chamber with a turbomolecular pump results in high Vm values and excellent run-to-run reproducibility.},

Molybdenum-Rhenium (MoRe) is a disordered superconducting alloy with a noble surface chemistry and a relatively high transition temperature. These properties make it attractive for SMR applications, but characterization of MoRe SMR has not yet been reported. Here, we present the fabrication and characterization of SMR fabricated with a MoRe 60\textendash{}40 alloy. At low drive powers, we observe internal quality-factors as high as 700 000. Temperature and power dependence of the internal quality-factors suggest the presence of the two level systems from the dielectric substrate dominating the internal loss at low temperatures. We further test the compatibility of these resonators with high temperature processes, such as for carbon nanotube chemical vapor deposition growth, and their performance in the magnetic field, an important characterization for hybrid systems.},

However, the future prospects ultimately depend upon the intrinsic coherence of Josephson junctions, and whether superconducting qubits can be adequately isolated from their environment. We introduce a new architecture for superconducting quantum circuits employing a three-dimensional resonator that suppresses qubit decoherence while maintaining sufficient coupling to the control signal. With the new architecture, we demonstrate that Josephson junction qubits are highly coherent, with T2{{$\sim$}}10 to 20 {{$\mu$}}s without the use of spin echo, and highly stable, showing no evidence for 1/f critical current noise. These results suggest that the overall quality of Josephson junctions in these qubits will allow error rates of a few 10-4, approaching the error correction threshold.},

In contrast to the conductivity of conventional two-dimensional materials, graphene's conductivity at the Dirac point is geometry-dependent because of conduction via evanescent modes, approaching the theoretical value 4e2/{{$\pi$}}h (where e is the electron charge and h is Planck's constant) only for short and wide devices.

  abstract = {We theoretically consider the observed soft gap in the proximity-induced superconducting state of semiconductor nanowires in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman spin splitting, and tunneling leads, but in the absence of any extrinsic disorder (i.e., an ideal system). We critically consider the effects of three distinct intrinsic physical mechanisms (tunnel barrier to normal leads, temperature, and dissipation) on the phenomenology of the gap softness in the differential conductance spectroscopy of the normal-superconductor junction as a function of spin splitting and chemical potential. We find that all three mechanisms individually can produce a soft gap, leading to calculated conductance spectra qualitatively mimicking experimental results. We also show through extensive numerical simulations that the phenomenology of the soft gap is intrinsically tied to the broadening and the height of the Majorana zero-mode-induced differential conductance peak above the topological quantum phase transition point with both the soft gap and the quality of the Majorana zero mode being simultaneously affected by tunnel barrier, temperature, and dissipation. We establish that the Majorana zero-mode splitting oscillations can be suppressed by temperature or dissipation (in a similar manner) but not by the tunnel barrier. Since all three mechanisms (plus disorder, not considered in the current work) are likely to be present in any realistic nanowires, discerning the effects of various mechanisms is difficult, necessitating detailed experimental data as a function of all the system parameters, some of which (e.g., dissipation, chemical potential, tunnel barrier) may not be known experimentally. While the tunneling-induced soft-gap behavior is benign with no direct adverse effect on the Majorana topological properties with the zero-bias peak remaining quantized at 2e2/h, the soft gap induced by finite temperature and/or finite dissipation is detrimental to topological properties and must be avoided as much as possible.},

As the size of a device becomes comparable to the electron coherence length, however, quantum interference between electron waves becomes increasingly important, leading to dramatic changes in device properties1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. This classical-to-quantum transition in device behaviour suggests the possibility for nanometer-sized electronic elements that make use of quantum coherence1,2,7,8. Molecular electronic devices are promising candidates for realizing such device elements because the electronic motion in molecules is inherently quantum mechanical9,10 and it can be modified by well defined chemistry11,12,13. Here we describe an example of a coherent molecular electronic device whose behaviour is explicitly dependent on quantum interference between propagating electron waves\textemdash{}a Fabry\textendash{}Perot electron resonator based on individual single-walled carbon nanotubes with near-perfect ohmic contacts to electrodes.

Nonetheless, the efforts have been hindered by the diffusive nature of the conducting channels and interfaces. To overcome the obstacles, we vertically sandwiched a cleaved graphene monoatomic layer as the normal-conducting spacer between superconducting electrodes. The atomically thin single-crystalline graphene layer serves as an ultimately short conducting channel, with highly transparent interfaces with superconductors. In particular, we show the strong Josephson coupling reaching the theoretical limit, the convex-shaped temperature dependence of the Josephson critical current and the exceptionally skewed phase dependence of the Josephson current; all demonstrate the bona fide short and ballistic Josephson nature. This vertical stacking scheme for extremely thin transparent spacers would open a new pathway for exploring the exotic coherence phenomena occurring on an atomic scale.},

Defining a new simulation setup is very similar to describing the corresponding mathematical model. Kwant offers direct support for calculations of transport properties (conductance, noise, scattering matrix), dispersion relations, modes, wave functions, various Green's functions, and out-of-equilibrium local quantities. Other computations involving tight-binding Hamiltonians can be implemented easily thanks to its extensible and modular nature.

The inductance is either set by tailoring the metal-oxide dimensions of single JJs, or magnetically tuned by parallelizing multiple JJs in superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) with local current-biased flux lines. JJs based on superconductor-semiconductor hybrids represent a tantalizing all-electric alternative. The gatemon is a recently developed transmon variant which employs locally gated nanowire (NW) superconductor-semiconductor JJs for qubit control. Here, we go beyond proof-of-concept and demonstrate that semiconducting channels etched from a wafer-scale two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) are a suitable platform for building a scalable gatemon-based quantum computer.

  abstract = {We investigate the noise-affected I-V curves of small-area Josephson junctions through experiment, simulation, and theory. In particular, we consider I-V curves in which two different states of finite voltage coexist at the same dc bias: a high-voltage state that corresponds to the usual quasiparticle branch and a low-voltage state that is characterized by thermally activated phase diffusion. The observed hysteresis between the phase-diffusion and quasiparticle branches cannot be explained within the context of the simple resistively and capacitively shunted junction (RCSJ) model but is explained by extended models in which the damping increases with frequency. Frequency-dependent damping is shown to produce a qualitative change in the attractors of the noise-free system which allows the two voltage states to be simultaneously stable. This picture is confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations which accurately reproduce the experimental I-V curves of two different samples over a wide range of temperatures. In addition we develop analytic expressions for three key parameters of the I-V curve of junctions displaying hysteresis between the phase-diffusion and quasiparticle branches: the initial slope of the phase-diffusion branch, the bias level at which the junction switches from the phase-diffusion branch to the quasiparticle branch, and the bias level at which it returns to the phase-diffusion branch.},

Although Kranz is often attributed with having spoken those words during the mission, he did not. The origin of the phrase is from the preparation for the 1995 film Apollo 13 according to FDO Flight Controller Jerry Bostick:

In preparation for the movie, the script writers, Al Reinart and Bill Broyles, came down to Clear Lake to interview me on "What are the people in Mission Control really like?" One of their questions was "Weren't there times when everybody, or at least a few people, just panicked?" My answer was "No, when bad things happened, we just calmly laid out all the options, and failure was not one of them." ... I immediately sensed that Bill Broyles wanted to leave and assumed that he was bored with the interview. Only months later did I learn that when they got in their car to leave, he started screaming, "That's it! That's the tag line for the whole movie, Failure is not an option.},

  volume = {93},
  abstract = {We study the Josephson current in long ballistic superconductor-monolayer graphene-superconductor junctions. As a first step, we have developed an efficient computational approach to calculate the Josephson current in tight-binding systems. This approach can be particularly useful in the long-junction limit, which has hitherto attracted less theoretical interest but has recently become experimentally relevant. We use this computational approach to study the dependence of the critical current on the junction geometry, doping level, and an applied perpendicular magnetic field B. In zero magnetic field we find a good qualitative agreement with the recent experiment of M. Ben Shalom et al. [Nat. Phys. 12, 318 (2016)] for the length dependence of the critical current. For highly doped samples our numerical calculations show a broad agreement with the results of the quasiclassical formalism. In this case the critical current exhibits Fraunhofer-like oscillations as a function of B. However, for lower doping levels, where the cyclotron orbit becomes comparable to the characteristic geometrical length scales of the system, deviations from the results of the quasiclassical formalism appear. We argue that due to the exceptional tunability and long mean free path of graphene systems a new regime can be explored where geometrical and dynamical effects are equally important to understand the magnetic field dependence of the critical current.},

The experimental results have been accurately described by the quasiclassical Green's-function technique in the Keldysh formalism. Taking into account the geometry of the structure, different energy scales, and the nonidealities at the interfaces allows us to obtain a quantitative agreement between the theory and the experimental results in both the amplitude and the phase dependence of the supercurrent, with no or very few fitting parameters. Here we discuss the most important factors involved with such comparisons: the ratio between the superconducting order parameter and the Thouless energy of the junction, the effect of additional wires on the weak link, and the effects due to imperfections, most notably due to the nonideal interfaces.},

Here we fabricate bipolar Josephson junctions of graphene, in which a p-n potential barrier is formed in graphene with two closely spaced superconducting contacts, and realize supercurrent ON/OFF states using electrostatic gating only. The bipolar Josephson junctions of graphene also show fully gate-driven macroscopic quantum tunnelling behaviour of Josephson phase particles in a potential well, where the confinement energy is gate tuneable. We suggest that the supercurrent OFF state is mainly caused by a supercurrent dephasing mechanism due to a random pseudomagnetic field generated by ripples in graphene, in sharp contrast to other nanohybrid Josephson junctions. Our study may pave the way for the development of new gate-tuneable superconducting quantum information devices.},

We find that BN substrates result in extraordinarily flat graphene layers that display microscopic Moir{\'e} patterns arising from the relative orientation of the graphene and BN lattices. Gate-dependent dI/dV spectra of graphene on BN exhibit spectroscopic features that are sharper than those obtained for graphene on SiO2.

To date, deterministic transfer methods rely on the use of sacrificial polymer layers and wet chemistry to some extent. Here, we develop an all-dry transfer method that relies on viscoelastic stamps and does not employ any wet chemistry step. This is found to be very advantageous to freely suspend these materials as there are no capillary forces involved in the process.
