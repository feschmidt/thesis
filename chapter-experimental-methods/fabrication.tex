\subsection{The art of making encapsulated graphene devices}

Fabrication of graphene Josephson junctions is a tedious process:
% 
In contrast to integrated circuits, where the active materials are homogeneously deposited over an entire substrate, which enables massive parallel processing, the best graphene devices to date are not fabricated using scalable techniques, but rather each device is manually assembled and crafted.
%
This requires significant efforts, since no two devices have the same exact shape, which often results in slightly different properties between devices.


The most promising wafer-scale graphene fabrication is achieved by chemical vapor deposition of single layer graphene on copper foils~\cite{zhangReviewChemicalVapor2013,linBridgingGapReality2018}.
% 
However, only until recently did such deposited films exhibit sufficiently low defect densities for high quality transport, which would otherwise result in inferior device quality~\cite{banszerusBallisticTransportExceeding2016a,neumaierIntegratingGrapheneSemiconductor2019}.
% 
Additionally, device quality can be reduced by contaminations that are often encountered when transferring the graphene layer from its growth to the final substrate.
% 
Finally, even in the cases where transferred graphene itself only exhibits low defect and residue densities, patterning it into the final device shape almost exclusively contaminates it, most often via organic resist residues.

Since single layer graphene (SLG) is really only a single atom thick and thus all electronic transport takes place at its surface, contaminations on either side will result in charge carrier scattering and degrade the device performance.
% 
Till this day, the vast majority of devices with highest electronic quality, exhibiting phenomena such as ballistic transport, hydrodynamics, or superconductivity, rely on single layer graphene manually exfoliated from bulk graphite crystals~\cite{mayorovMicrometerScaleBallisticTransport2011b,bandurinNegativeLocalResistance2016a,caoCorrelatedInsulatorBehaviour2018,caoUnconventionalSuperconductivityMagicangle2018a}.


Additionally, it is often required to tune the carrier density in the graphene layer, for which a gate electrode separated by a dielectric is needed.
% 
Because of the single-layer nature of graphene, it conforms very well to any surface roughness and is very sensitive to trapped charges in the dielectric layers.
%
Significant efforts were put into removing the substrate entirely, thus freely suspending graphene.
%
This, in conjunction with device annealing to burn off fabrication residues, can result in remarkably high-quality samples~\cite{duApproachingBallisticTransport2008a,rickhausBallisticInterferencesSuspended2013,mizunoBallisticlikeSupercurrentSuspended2013a,kiHighQualityMultiterminalSuspended2013,maurandFabricationBallisticSuspended2014,rickhausGateTuneableBeamsplitter2015,rickhausGuidingElectronsFewMode2015}.
% 
However, such devices are highly fragile and fabrication can be tedious~\cite{rickhausElectronOpticsBallistic2015}.
%
On the other hand, finding an inert dielectric would ease fabrication needs.
%
To this end, Dean \textit{et al.}~\cite{deanBoronNitrideSubstrates2010} realized the use of hexagonal Boron Nitride (BN) as the (until now) best dielectric and capping layer for graphene devices, showing vast improvements with respect to device mobility.


Like graphene, BN has a hexagonal lattice, albeit consisting of two sub-lattices of boron and nitride atoms with a lattice mismatch of \SI{1}{\percent} to graphene.
% 
BN can be exfoliated from bulk crystals to thin insulating films of arbitrary layer number and signifcantly lower surface roughness than any other dielectric, making it a perfect match for graphene encapsulation.
% 
The highest quality BN crystals, i.e. the ones exhibiting the lowest charge defect density, are made by high pressure synthesis by Kenji Watanabe and Takashi Taniguchi at the \textit{National Institute for Material Sciences} (NIMS), Japan~\cite{taniguchiSynthesisHighpurityBoron2007,zastrowMeetCrystalGrowers2019}.

As confirmed by atomic force and scanning tunneling microscopy, SLG on BN exhibits significantly lower roughness compared to samples on \ce{SiO2}, until then the standard dielectric for graphene devices.
% 
In addition, variations in the local density of states of SLG on BN is reduced by a factor ten, while charge fluctuations are suppressed by a factor 100, as compared to SLG directly on \ce{SiO2}~\cite{xueScanningTunnellingMicroscopy2011,deckerLocalElectronicProperties2011}.
% 
Complete screening of any trapped charges in the dielectric layer is possible with gate electrodes out of graphite instead of conventional metals~\cite{ponomarenkoTunableMetalInsulator2011,ametNovelPhenomenaDriven2014}.
%
BN encapsulation even enables ballistic transport in very high quality CVD graphene devices~\cite{banszerusBallisticTransportExceeding2016a}.


Flake transfer procedures have since paved the way for the assembly of so-called van der Waals heterostructures, named so due to the van der Waals forces holding the flakes together.
%
This has allowed for all kinds of exfoliatable crystals to be stacked, which enabled a new method of studying emergent phenomena such as induced spin orbit coupling, ferromagnetism or superconductivity~\cite{geimVanWaalsHeterostructures2013a,novoselov2DMaterialsVan2016}.
%
In this PhD thesis, however, we limit ourselves to the use of only SLG and BN to study induced superconductivity in the SLG.
%
Even so, assembling a heterostructure of BN-G-BN, with subsequent patterning, and deposition of gate metals and dielectrics results in an extensive and long process, with processes varying between most research groups.
% 
In the following, we will detail the fabrication procedure used in the course of this thesis that resulted in the best measured devices.

\subsubsection{Substrate cleaning and flake exfoliation}

All BN-G-BN heterostructures are based on SLG and few-layer BN exfoliated from bulk highly oriented pyrolithic graphite (HOPG) and NIMS, respectively.
% 
Identifying flakes of suitable thickness is done by estimation the layer number and thickness from optical images.
% 
For optimal contrast~\cite{blakeMakingGrapheneVisible2007b}, we used silicon substrates with \SI{285}{\nano\meter} of dry chlorinated thermal \ce{SiO2}, diced into \SI{6x6}{\milli\meter} pieces from \SI{4}{inch} wafers from \textit{NOVA Electronic Materials}.
% 
Details on dicing parameters are given in Sec.~\ref{sec:fab-packaging}.


As mentioned earlier, any organic residues that come in contact with graphene will very likely lead to inferior device performance.
% 
Specifically, after dicing the chips, they need to be cleaned extensively in order to remove any leftovers from the dicing resist.
% 
To this end, diced chips are placed in a teflon holder and transferred through four \SI{50}{\milli\liter} glass beakers filled with acetone, acetone, isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol, IPA) and IPA, each time ultrasonicated for \SI{5}{\minute}.
% 
The chips can either be blow-dried one by one using high-pressure nitrogen gas, or by rinsing the teflon holder with the chips still on it in three water baths and placing it on a petri dish in an oven.
% 
To remove acetone and IPA residues, the chips are ultrasonicated for \SI{5}{\minute} in nitric acid and blow-dried after rinsing in water.
% 
We found that an additional soft oxygen plasma to functionalize the \ce{SiO2} surface (\SI{200}{sccm} of \ce{O2}, \SI{600}{\watt}, \SI{2}{\minute}, no cage in a \textit{PVA Tepla 300}) just before, i.e. not more than \SI{15}{\minute} prior to, flake exfoliation increased flake exfoliation yield, regardless of graphene or BN.

While there already exist fully automized exfoliation-to-heterostructure stations~\cite{masubuchiAutonomousRoboticSearching2018a}, we performed all of the following steps manually.
%
Flake exfoliation is achieved by manually thinning down bulk crystals until micron-sized flakes of only one or two (SLG, BLG) or a few tens of layers (BN) thickness are left on a chip.
% 
We estimate that there are as many different ways of flake exfoliation as there are researchers working on this procedure.
% 
The procedure that worked best for us concerning BN exfoliation consists of placing individual BN crystallites (approximately a few \SI{100x100x100}{\micro\meter} in volume) on a piece of \textit{Scotch} tape \textit{"Magic"} or \textit{Nitto} tape\footnote{Nitto Processing Tape SWT20+ REACH R 280X100, bought from TELTEC GmbH}, and subsequently folding over said piece of tape numerous times, such that one acquires a closed layer of thin BN crystallites.
% 
In the case of graphene, we would peel off a preferably closed film of graphite from a single \SI{1x1}{\centi\meter} HOPG crystal with a piece of tape, followed by subsequent folding of the piece of tape until we acquired a homogeneous, yet closed film of thin graphite.


Once satisfied with the tape template, we used pre-cut \SI{8x8}{\milli\meter} pieces of clean tape to peel off crystals from the template and press the side with crystals on the small piece of tape onto a previously cleaned substrate.
%
After having kept pressure applied for approximately \SI{30}{\second}, we transferred the substrate with the tape still on to a hot plate and left the chip sit for \SIrange{2}{5}{\minute}.
% 
We found highest flake densities for temperatures of \SI{50}{\celsius} for \textit{Nitto} and \SI{100}{\celsius} for \textit{Magic} tape.
% 
Finally, the chip was transferred off the hot plate, left to cool for \SI{1}{\minute} and the tape was gently peeled off, while holding the substrate in place with a pair of tweezers.
% 
During this process, no further pressure should be applied to the tape as this usually results in lots of tape residues on the chip.


The process of exfoliation turns out to be a tradeoff between getting as many flakes as possible, and getting the lowest tape residues possibles.
% 
\textit{Magic} tape has a higher adhesive strength, thus resulting in a higher flake density and predominantly large flakes (i.e. larger than \SI{20x20}{\micro\meter}) compared to \textit{Nitto} tape.
% 
On the other hand, this comes at the cost of more tape residues on both substrate and the individual flakes.
% 
Tape residues can lead to enhanced charge carrier scattering of graphene films, thus severely limiting device quality.
% 
Additionally, they increase the chance of bubble formation (see below), thus limiting the available sample space.
% 
Tape residues can be entirely removed by thermal annealing at \SI{400}{\celsius} in  an \ce{Ar + H2} atmosphere.
% 
However, it proved extremely difficult to pick up or transfer flakes treated in this manner for heterostructure assembly.
% 
While we found that annealing at temperatures below \SI{300}{\celsius} was still compatible with flake transfer, significantly less tape residues were removed this way.
% 
It is thus advisable to omit thermal annealing until the first lithography step and instead settle on a slightly lower exfoliation yield.

\subsubsection{Heterostructure assembly}

For assembling our BN-G heterostructures, we used the original transfer setup of Castellanos-Gomez \textit{et al.}~\cite{castellanos-gomezDeterministicTransferTwodimensional2014d}, upgraded with a heater stage capable of fast heating and cooling cycles between room temperature and \SI{200}{\celsius}.
%
Heterostructures were assembled with a modified version of the procedures developed by Pizzocchero \textit{et al.}~\cite{pizzoccheroHotPickupTechnique2016a} and Zomer \textit{et al.}~\cite{zomerFastPickTechnique2014b}.
% 
BN-G-BN structures are formed by repeated pick-and-place of SLG and few-layer BN (flake thickness between \SIrange{10}{50}{\nano\meter}).
%
The process makes use of the change in viscoelasticity of an adhesive film on top of an elastic cushion of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which is stuck to a microscope glass slide.
%
Heating this transfer template above the glass transition temperature $T_g$ of the polymer expands the cushion and allows the adhesive film to become viscous, thus conforming and adhering strongly to flakes covered by it.
%
Cooling below $T_g$ then solidifies the polymer and flakes will be picked up by lifting the transfer template.

We used two different adhesive films, either polypropylene carbonate (PPC) or polybisphenol carbonate (PC).
%
We prepared the PPC solution by dissolving PPC acquired from \textit{SigmaAldrich}\footnote{Poly(propylene carbonate), average $M_n\sim50,000$ by GPC. SigmaAldrich product no. 389021, CAS 25511-85-7, MDL MFCD00197919} at a \SI{15}{\percent} weight ratio in anisole\footnote{Anisole, ReagentPlus\textsuperscript{\textregistered}, \SI{99}{\percent}. SigmaAldrich product no. 123226, CAS 100-66-3, MDL MFCD00008354} at \SI{50}{\celsius}, while stirring with a fish magnet until everything was properly dissolved.
%
The PC\footnote{Poly(Bisphenol A carbonate), average $m_W\sim 45,000$ by GPC. SigmaAldrich product no. 181625, CAS 25037-45-0, MDL MFCD00084476} was dissolved in chloroform\footnote{Chloroform, anhydrous, $\geq\SI{99}{\percent}$, contains \SIrange{0.5}{1.0}{\percent} ethanol as stabilizer. SigmaAldrich product no. 288306, CAS 67-66-3, MDL MFCD00000826} at a \SI{6}{\percent} weight ratio.
%
While PPC requires lower working temperatures than PC, thus making it easier to align template and substrate, we have observed that temperatures above \SI{110}{\celsius} resulted in fewer bubbles at the flake interfaces during transfer.
%
The advantage of PC over PPC is that it is a much stronger adhesive, so the intermediate flake delamination (step \ref{flake-delam}) can be skipped.
%
However, it needs to be kept in a fridge in order to not degrade, and cannot be spin-coated on the PDMS layer, whereas PPC can.
%
Instead, a droplet of PC is placed on a \SI{20x20}{\milli\meter} glass coverslip.
%
A second coverslip is dropped on the first one, thus spreading the droplet in between.
%
With care, but in a swift motion, we pull the top glass piece off, thus leaving behind a thin film of PC on the bottom glass slide, which can be peeled off using a piece of tape and placed on the PDMS stamp.

For every pick-and-place step, we fixed the substrate from or to which to transfer the flakes with vacuum, and used a single glass slide with a bubble of PDMS covered with PPC or PC.
%
Both glass slide and chip could be individually moved with micrometer screws.
%
The following steps describe our typical working process for achieving high-quality interfaces using the PPC method:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Align the top BN flake with the center area of the PDMS/PPC template.
	%
	Lower the glass slide such that the PPC touches the substrate.
	%
	Take care that the PPC does not yet cover the flake, but touches down less than \SI{100}{\micro\meter} away from it.
	%
	\item Increase the stage temperature above \SI{55}{\celsius}.
	%
	The PDMS/PPC will expand and cover the flake, and adhesion between BN and PPC increase significantly.
	%
	\item Turn off the stage heater and wait for the stage to cool below \SI{40}{\celsius} (possibly with the help of a nitrogen gun).
	%
	At this stage, the adhesion between BN and PPC should exceed that of BN and substrate.
	%
	Now lifting the glass slide should rip the flake off the substrate.
	%
	If at this stage the intended flake did not get picked up, repeating the process by heating to \SIrange{80}{90}{\celsius} and then cooling down should result in a much higher yield, at cost of longer waiting times for the stage to cool down.
	%
	\item Place the chip with the graphene flake on the stage and align the flake with the BN on the glass slide below now.
	%
	Slowly lower the glass slide and set the stage temperature to \SI{110}{\celsius}. 
	%
	The hot air and deflected slide will make it difficult to align the two flakes, so extra care has to be taken at this step.
	%
	Once the stage has reached \SI{110}{\celsius}, bring stage and glass slide in contact as slowly as possible until the interface passes the Gr and BN, preferably letting the expanding PDMS do the work.
	%
	\label{assembly-start}
	%
	\item Increase the stage temperature to \SI{120}{\celsius} and then retract the glass slide, thus delaminating the top BN on the graphene flake.
	%
	\label{flake-delam}
	\item Anneal the Gr/hBN stack at \SI{170}{\celsius} for \SI{15}{\minute}.
	%
	\item Place PPC/PDMS glass slide above the chip, turn off the stage heater and bring the polymer in contact once the temperature is below \SIrange{70}{80}{\celsius}.
	% 
	\item Once the temperature drops below \SI{40}{\celsius}, retract the glass slide.
	%
	The Gr/hBn stack should get lifted off the substrate.
	%
	\label{assembly-stop}
	%
	\item For assembling the BN-G-BN sandwich, repeat steps \ref{assembly-start} - \ref{assembly-stop}.
	%
	If needed, transfer the sandwich to another substrate.
\end{enumerate}

For flake transfer using PC, we follow the above steps, except that the transfer takes place at a base temperature of \SI{110}{\celsius} instead of \SI{40}{\celsius}, and to activate the adhesion to PC, heating to \SIrange{130}{140}{\celsius} instead of \SIrange{80}{90}{\celsius} is required.

\subsubsection{Challenges of heterostructure assembly}

Compared to interfacing van der Waals heterostructures with DC circuitry, numerous challenges arise for integration with RF devices.
%
RF circuits in coplanar architecture, such as the ones in this thesis, need a metallic ground plane around the conducting lines, separated by micron-sized gaps.
%
Due to the long-range interaction of electromagnetic fields, fabrication residues of any kind (metallic, dielectric, organic) should be avoided as much as possible to ensure reliable circuit operation.


That being said, the nature of flake transfer always introduces contaminations.
%
For one, the polymer used for transfer has very strong adhesion to the metal areas of the shunts, ground planes and center conductors.
%
While during stack assembly on oxidized silicon, the polymer would only touch the substrate preliminary, when attempting to delaminate the heterostructure on the pre-patterned substrates, the polymer often ripped off the PDMS carrier and would also get delaminated, cf. Fig.~\ref{fig:fab-hetero-challenge}(a).
%
Additionally, van der Waals crystals have strong adhesion to the metals used in our work, which resulted in a number of residual flakes on the final chip surrounding the intended heterostructure.
%
A long soak in NMP was able to remove the polymer at least visibly, but residual flakes had to be etched away in a separate step.


On the other hand, flake adhesion to the substrate itself was found to vary from good to extremely poor:
%
We found that BN-G-BN stacks would often get washed away due to unsufficient adhesion to sapphire substrates during processing.
%
Due to the low adhesion of BN to sapphire and silicon nitride, many stacks were washed off the final substrates when dissolving the polymer.
%
While the transfer yield of heterostructures on sapphire and silicon nitride was only as low as \SI{50}{\percent} and \SI{0}{\percent}, respectively, we did not observe this behaviour on silicon and silicon oxide surfaces, (cf. Fig.~\ref{fig:fab-hetero-challenge}(b)), where all delaminated flakes would stick.
%
Note that even adhesion promotion using HMDS (hexamethyldisilazane, \ce{[(CH3)3Si]2NH}) did not improve this issue.


When stacking flakes on top of each other, hydrocarbon gases and water, usually covering all surfaces in ambient conditions, can get trapped in between flakes~\cite{haighCrosssectionalImagingIndividual2012}, similar to air pockets encountered when placing protective covers on flat surfaces such as phone screens or windows.
%
These bubbles can cluster together, reaching pressures of up to \SI{1}{\giga\pascal}~\cite{khestanovaUniversalShapePressure2016,ghorbanfekr-kalashamiDependenceShapeGraphene2017} and resulting in local pseudomagnetic fields in excess of \SI{300}{\tesla}~\cite{levyStrainInducedPseudoMagneticFields2010}.
%
Bubbles are hence undesired since they pose strong charge carrier scattering centers.
%
Nevertheless, high substrate temperatures, both during and after assembly, can mobilize these gasses, allowing them to clear up large sample spaces by accumulating along flake defects.
%
We have occasionally observed bubbles piercing the top BN and escape from the stack when annealing the heterostructures at temperatures above \SI{300}{\celsius}.

For these reasons, every single gJJ has to be designed by hand, since it is important to place the structure to be fabricated in an area without bubbles present in order to obtain a high-quality device.
%
After stack placement on the final chip, we took several optical and atomic force microscope images to determine the graphene location with respect to alignment marks, and to identify bubble-free areas, cf. Fig~\ref{fig:fab-hetero-challenge}(b).
%
These combined images are loaded into the CAD software (we highly recommend \textit{KLayout}, or \textit{LibreCAD} as an alternative) to design the electrodes and gates for the gJJ, as shown in Fig~\ref{fig:fab-hetero-challenge}(c).

\subsubsection{Device patterning and arising challenges}\label{sec:fabgJJ}

Since the gJJ have to be individually designed are not fabricated scalably, we chose to first pattern the RF circuitry on either large silicon chips, or \SI{2}{inch} sapphire wafers, and subsequently transfer the BN-G heterostructures on the final substrate, where they are patterned into the gate-tunable gJJ.
%
Fabrication was carried out in the class 10000 (ISO 7) cleanroom of the \textit{Kavli Nanolab Delft}, which offers class 100 (ISO 5) wet bench areas for sample processing.
%
While the RF circuits could also have been fabricated using photolithography, we patterned all devices using electron beam lithography with either one of the \textit{Raith EBPG 5200} or \textit{5000+}.
%
Dry-etching was done using \textit{Leybold Heraeus Fluor} reactive ion etchers, dielectric deposition with PECVD in an \textit{Oxford Instruments PlasmaPro 80}.
%
Superconductors were deposited in sputtering systems from \textit{AJA International, Inc.} and \textit{Alliance Concept}.

The graphene Josephson junctions were fabricated the etch-fill technique pioneered by Wang \textit{et al.}~\cite{wangOneDimensionalElectricalContact2013b}, with added top-gates as in Refs.~\cite{nandaCurrentPhaseRelationBallistic2017,schmidtBallisticGrapheneSuperconducting2018}.
%
Compared to fabrication on oxidized silicon, we encountered numerous challenges during fabrication that needed to be addressed before samples could be processed reliably.
%
We chose NbTiN as superconductor for the contacts to graphene after the MoRe target in our lab ran empty, and since the use of NbTiN was well established in the neighboring group of Leo Kouwenhoven~\cite{popinciucZerobiasConductancePeak2012,mourikSignaturesMajoranaFermions2012}.

We found that for ebeam lithography on sapphire substrates, a conductive charging layer on top of the bilayer PMMA in the form of Electra 92 (AllResist AR-PC 5091) was crucial to create high-resolution patterns, such as Josephson junctions with length x width of \SI{0.5x5}{\micro\meter}.
%
Without a conductive layer, the resist would consistently be exposed in the center of the junction, leading to a nano-short at this spot, cf. Fig.~\ref{fig:fabgJJchallenges}(a-c).
%
This issue does not appear on silicon with or without oxide, since the band gaps of these materials are low enough for them to be somewhat conductive at room temperature.
%
Failure to use a conductive layer during ebeam exposure of sapphire can even lead to physical damage to the EBPG in the case of sudden electrical discharge.
%
Note that Electra 92 needs to be stored in a fridge and the bottle has to be warmed up to room temperature before being opened to avoid water condensation.
%
Additionally, Electra needs to be washed off after ebeam exposure and before resist development in a simple water bath.
%
Most importantly, the chip needs to be blow-dried from the water bath before development and should not be transferred from the water bath into the developer, as mixing either water and IPA, or water and developer can lead to overdevelopment of the resist.

Various samples also exhibited cracks in the resist after ebeam exposure and development, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fabgJJchallenges}(d).
%
These cracks were up to several tens of microns long and usually originated in sharp bends or corners of patterned structures, as well as from the edgebeads on bare chips coated with either PMMA or CSAR.
%
They are most likely due to a combination of tensile film stress in the resist and insufficient resist adhesion to the substrate~\cite{jacksonMicrofabricationNanomanufacturing2006}:
%
When a film does not properly adhere to the substrate, developer can peel off parts of the resist.
%
Tensile stress in the resist accelerates this issue and can lead to long cracks, especially starting at sharp corners.
%
Resist cracking could be avoided by changing the pattern shape to rounded corners and improving resist adhesion.
%
One method was to coat the substrate with a monolayer of HMDS (hexamethyldisilazane, \ce{[(CH3)3Si]2NH}) from \textit{MicroChemicals} from the gas phase prior to resist application.
%
For this, we used the hotplate with integrated HMDS deposition system of a \textit{Suss MicroTec Delta 80 RC}, with prebaking at \SI{150}{\celsius} for \SI{6}{\minute}.
% 
We found that this immensely helped against both cracks in various resists (PMMA, CSAR), regardless of whether the substrate was metallic or dielectric, and even under-etching of dielectrics with BOE.
%
Alternatively, applying the resist to be spun on the chip and just letting the chip rest for \SIrange{30}{60}{\second} before spinning significantly improved resist adhesion as well.
%
We speculate that the water layer present on all surfaces in ambient conditions needs this long to be replaced by the resist, which then stuck much better to the substrate.
%
We note that for PMMA, cold development with a combination of IPA and water at a 3:1 ratio also solves the issue of cracking resists and can even improve feature resolution~\cite{rooksLowStressDevelopment2002,cordOptimalTemperatureDevelopment2007}

Another issue commonly encountered during nanofabrication, in particular when performing lift-off, are so-called \textit{dog-ears}.
%
These are visible as metal parts sticking to the edges of patterned areas and are due to the side-coverage of the resist protecting other areas.
%
Since sputtering leads to fairly isotropic deposition (compared to directional deposition with metal evaporation), sufficient resist undercut and thickness are necessary to facilitate liftoff.
%
These requirements also restrict the minimum feature size that can be reliably patterned.
%
Typically, a resist-to-metal ratio at least 3:1 allows stable liftoff.
%
However, the etch-fill technique requires a careful balance between choosing a thick enough resist in order to have enough resist left after dry-etching for good liftoff, while not making it too thin for high-resolution patterning.
%
A lower resist thickness can be chosen for lift-off if sufficient undercut is present, which is why a bilayer resist of PMMA was chosen.
%
This undercut can be enhanced by longer development.
%
Additionally, dry-etching at high pressures was found to be fairly isotropic and thus widening patterned structures and even increasing the undercut.
%
Judging from optical images, this resulted in an undercut of approximately \SIrange{100}{150}{\nano\meter}.
%
Some dog-ears could be removed by using an unused transfer template with PPC polymer, with which we were able to pull away some dogears which would then stick to the polymer.
%
Using ultrasonication during liftoff typically works well with removing dog-ears.
%
Due to the violent agitation and previously experienced problems with stack adhesion to the substrate, we opted against this procedure.
%
Instead, we used the jet stream of syringes filled with PRS3000 inside the filled beaker in which the liftoff was happening, to aid the process.


The final process flow is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fabgJJ}(a-f) and Tab.~\ref{tab:fabgJJ}.
%
As a trade-off between strong superconducting coupling and reliable sample fabrication, we designed all gJJ to be \SI{500}{\nano\meter} long.
%
Cross-sectional SEM showed side-angles of approximately \SI{60}{\degree} at the contact interfaces, allowing for good overlap between metal contacts and graphene layer.
%
We chose hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ, \ce{[HSiO3/2]_n}, \cite{namatsuThreedimensionalSiloxaneResist1998}) as a spin-on gate dielectric due to its process reversibility, good step coverage and straightforward thickness variability.
%
HSQ needs to be stored in a fridge, like Electra 92, and has to be warmed up to room temperature before applying on the sample.
%
Once BN-G heterostructures would stick to the sapphire chip, and including the use of Electra 92, the device yield, i.e. gate-tunable supercurrents, was approximately \SI{70}{\percent}.

\subsection{Fabrication of DC bias cavities}\label{sec:fabRF}

The process for fabricating DC bias cavities consists of three main steps:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Deposit and pattern base layer (CPW, ground plane, shunt bottom part)
	\item Deposit and pattern shunt dielectric
	\item Deposit and pattern shunt top plate
\end{itemize}
%
For best fabrication results, a mono-layer of HMDS should be applied before every resist spinning, as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:fabgJJ}.
%
The use of Electra 92 for devices on sapphire is not strictly necessary due to the large feature size and the conducing metal base layer, but still recommended.

Care needs to be taken to ensure that there are no shorts in the shunt dielecric layer.
%
Since the dielectric deposition using PECVD does not necessarily provide complete step coverage, the dielectric layer should be at least \SI{30}{\percent} thicker than the base layer.
%
We found this to be problematic when patterning the base layer using dry etching on silicon substrates because the dry-etch process can cut deep into the silicon substrate, increasing the step height to be covered by the dielectric.
%
In this case, depositing a dielectric fill layer in the gaps slightly extending above the step edges, resulted in reliable device yield.

Instead of wet-etching the shunt capacitor dielectric, dry-etching using a \ce{CHF3 + O2} plasma at \SI{60}{\watt} power and base pressure of \SI{50}{\micro\bar} yielded comparable results.
%
However, the combination of plasma etching with negative ebeam resist often resulted in teflonization of the latter, severely complicating resist stripping afterwards.
%
This can be avoided by either in-situ \ce{O2} ashing, or by applying a thin PMMA layer below the negative ebeam resist, which can be stripped off the sample much easier.
%
From a safety perspective, the plasma etch process is to be preferred over the use of BOE due to the much lower risk to the operator's safety.
%
Additionally, even though wet-etching seems to be a cleaner process compared to dry-etching, the obtained microwave properties of samples fabricated using BOE did not reliably surpass those of dry-etched devices.

The RF circuits in Chapters~\ref{chap:gJJ} and \ref{chap:gJJ-CPR} are fabricated as listed in Tab~\ref{tab:fabRF}, while the one in Chapter~\ref{chap:currentdetection} used Al:Si as superconducting layer and silicon as substrate and dielectric layer.
%
In terms of internal quality factor $Q_i=\omega_0/\kappa_i$, the best devices with sapphire substrate and MoRe base layer showed $Q_i\approx\num{41e3}$, while DC bias cavities out of aluminum on silicon substrates and shunt dielectric had $Q_i\approx\num{29e3}$.
%
While not used for further measurements in this thesis, the reproducibly highest internal quality factors were achieved with sputter-deposited NbTiN on silicon after intensive wafer cleaning by our collaborators at \textit{SRON}~\cite{thoenSuperconductingNbTinThin2017}, and \ce{Si3N4} as dielectric with BOE patterning.
%
Figure~\ref{fig:s11NbTiN} shows the resulting reflection measurement of the best measured sample (cf. Fig.~\ref{fig:biascavityfab}(c)), with an internal quality factor $Q_i\approx\num{82439}$.

Even higher device quality could be achieved with a low-loss dielectric suchas \ce{Al2O3} and a more local deposition:
%
We speculate that depositing dielectric on the entire chip area might degrade the film quality by damaging the superconducting layer in areas where voltage fluctuations are non-negligible, thus introducing defects such as two-level systems which can absorb radiation and lead to internal losses.
%
Additionally, device patterning with dry-etching can physically roughen the superconducting base layer.
%
Even wet-etching, such as with BOE, can leave behind defects.
%
For example, we observed that ALD-deposited \ce{Al2O3} left micron-sized flakes on the chip, that could not entirely get dissolved in BOE.
%
As an alternative, we propose local deposition by liftoff, as can be done with low-temperature PECVD or ALD.
%
This could protect the surrounding circuitry and potentially reduce internal circuit losses.
