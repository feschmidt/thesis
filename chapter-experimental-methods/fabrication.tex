\subsection{The art of making encapsulated graphene devices}

Fabrication of graphene Josephson junctions is a tedious process:
% 
In contrast to integrated circuits, where the active materials are homogeneously deposited over an entire substrate, the best graphene devices to date are not fabricated using scalable techniques, but rather each device is manually assembled and crafted, thus requiring significant efforts, since no two devices have the same exact shape.

Wafer-scale graphene fabrication is usually achieved by chemical vapour deposition of single layer graphene on copper foils.
% 
However, only until recently did the thus deposited films exhibit sufficiently low defect densities, which would otherwise result in inferior device quality.
% 
Transferring the graphene layer from its growth to the final substrate often contaminates both graphene and final substrate, which typically result in low device quality.
% 
Finally, even in the cases where transferred graphene results in low defect and residue densities, patterning into the final device shape always results in contaminations, most often due to organic resist residues.

Since graphene is really only a single atom thick and thus all electronic transport takes place at its surface, contaminations on either side will result in charge carrier scattering and degrade the device performance.
% 
Till this day, the devices with highest electronic quality, exhibiting phenomena such as ballistic transport, hydrodynamics, or superconductivity, rely on single layer graphene manually exfoliated from bulk graphite crystals~\cite{???,???,???}.


Additionally, it is often required to change the carrier density in the graphene layer, for which a gate electrode separated by a dielectric is needed.
% 
Because of the single-layer nature of graphene, it conforms very well to any surface roughness and is very sensitive to trapped charges in the dielectric layers, which called for an ideal gate dielectric.
% 
In 2010, Dean \textit{et al.}~\cite{dean_boron_2010} realized the use of hexagonal Boron Nitride (BN) as the (until now) best dielectric and capping layer for graphene devices, showing vast improvements with respect to device mobility.

Like graphene, BN has a hexagonal lattice, albeit consisting of two sub-lattices of boron and nitride atoms, and with a lattice mismatch of \SI{1}{\percent} to graphene.
% 
BN can be exfoliated from bulk crystals to thin insulating films of arbitrary layer number and signifcantly lower surface roughness than any other dielectric, making it a perfect match for graphene encapsulation.
% 
The highest quality BN crystals, i.e. the ones exhibiting the lowest charge defect density, are the ones made by high pressure by Kenji Watanabe and Takashi Taniguchi at NIMS, Japan~\cite{taniguchi_synthesis_2007}.

As confirmed by atomic force and scanning tunneling microscopy, SLG on BN exhibits a significantly lower roughness compared to samples on \ce{SiO2}, until then the standard dielectric for graphene devices.
% 
In addition, variations in the local density of states of SLG on BN can thus be reduced by a factor ten, while charge fluctuations are suppressed by a factor 100, as compared to SLG directly on \ce{SiO2}~\cite{xueScanningTunnellingMicroscopy2011,deckerLocalElectronicProperties2011}.
% 
Complete screening of any trapped charges in the dielectric layer can finally be achieved with gate electrodes out of graphite instead of conventional metals~\cite{ponomarenkoTunableMetalInsulator2011,ametNovelPhenomenaDriven2014}.

However, assembling a heterostructure of BN-G-BN, with subsequent patterning, and deposition of gate metals and dielectrics results in an extensive and long process, with processes varying between most research groups.
% 
In the following, we will detail the fabrication procedure used in the course of this thesis that resulted in the best measured devices.

\subsubsection{Substrate cleaning and flake exfoliation}

All BN-G-BN heterostructures are based on SLG and few-layer BN exfoliated from bulk highly oriented pyrolithic graphite (HOPG) and NIMS, respectively.
% 
Identifying flakes of suitable thickness is done by estimation the layer number and thickness from optical images.
% 
For optimal contrast, we used silicon substrates with \SI{285}{\nano\meter} of thermal \ce{SiO2}~\cite{blakeMakingGrapheneVisible2007}, diced into \SI{6x6}{\milli\meter} pieces from \SI{4}{inch} wafers from ???.
% 
Details on dicing parameters are given in Sec.~\ref{sec:fab-packaging}.

As mentioned earlier, any organic residues that come in contact with graphene will very likely lead to inferior device performance.
% 
Specifically, after dicing the chips, they need to be cleaned extensively in order to remove any leftovers from the dicing resist.
% 
To this end, diced chips are placed in a teflon holder and transferred through four \SI{50}{\milli\liter} glass beakers filled with acetone, acetone, isopropyl alcohol (isoporpanol, IPA) and IPA, each time ultrasonicated for \SI{5}{\minute}.
% 
The chips can either be blow-dried one by one using high-pressure nitrogen gas, or by rinsing the teflon holder with the chips still on it in three water baths and placing it on a petri dish in an oven.
% 
To remove acetone and IPA residues, the chips ultrasonicated for \SI{5}{\minute} in nitric acid and blow-dried after rinsing in water.
% 
We found that an additional soft oxygen plasma to functionalize the \ce{SiO2} surface (\SI{200}{sccm} of \ce{O2}, \SI{600}{\watt}, \SI{2}{\minute}, no cage inside the Tepla) just before, i.e. not more than \SI{15}{\minute} prior to, flake exfoliation increased flake exfoliation yield, regardless of graphene or BN.


Flake exfoliation is achieved by manually thinning down bulk crystals until micron-sized flakes of only one or two (SLG, BLG) or a few tens of layers (BN) thickness are left on a chip.
% 
The author estimates that there are as many different ways of flake exfoliation as there are researchers working on this procedure.
% 
The procedure that worked best for us concerning BN exfoliation consists of placing individual BN crystallites (approximately a few $(\SI{100}{\micro\meter})^3$ in volume) on a piece of \textit{Scotch} tape \textit{"Magic"} or \textit{Nitto} tape, and subsequently folding over said piece of tape numerous times, such that one acquires a closed layer of thin BN crystallites.
% 
In the case of graphene, we would peel off a preferably closed film of graphite from a single \SI{1x1}{\centi\meter} HOPG crystal with a piece of tape, followed by subsequent folding of the piece of tape until we acquired a homogeneous, yet closed film of thin graphite.

Once we were satisfied with the tape template, we would use pre-cut \SI{8x8}{\milli\meter} pieces of clean tape to peel off crystals from the template, the press the side with crystals on the small piece of tape onto a previously cleaned substrate, keep pressure applied using our index finger or thumb for approximately \SI{30}{\second}, then transfer the substrate with the tape still on to a hot plate and leave the substrate sit on the hot plate for \SIrange{2}{5}{\minute}.
% 
We found highest flake densities for temperatures of \SI{50}{\celsius} for \textit{Nitto} and \SI{100}{\celsius} for \textit{Magic} tape.
% 
Finally, the chip was transferred off the hot plate, left to cool for \SI{1}{\minute} and the tape would be gently peeled off, while holding the substrate in place with a pair of tweezers.
% 
During this process, no further pressure should be applied to the tape as this usually resulted in lots of tape residues on the chip.


The process of exfoliation turns out to be a tradeoff between getting as many flakes as possible, and getting the lowest tape residues possibles.
% 
\textit{Magic} tape has a higher adhesive strength, thus resulting in a higher flake density and predominantly large flakes (i.e. $>(\SI{20}{\micro\meter})^2$) than \textit{Nitto} tape.
% 
On the other hand, this comes at the cost of more tape residues on both the substrate and the individual flakes.
% 
Tape residues can lead to enhanced charge carrier scattering of graphene films, thus severely limiting device quality.
% 
Additionally, they increase the chance of bubble formation (see below), thus limiting the available sample space.
% 
Tape residues can be entirely removed by thermal annealing at \SI{400}{\celsius} in  an \ce{Ar+H2} atmosphere.
% 
However, it extremely difficult to pick up or transfer flakes treated in this manner for heterostructure assembly (see below).
% 
While we found that annealing at temperatures below \SI{300}{\celsius} was still compatible with flake transfer, significantly less tape residues were removed this way.
% 
It is thus advisable to omit thermal annealing until the first lithography step.

\subsubsection{Heterostructure assembly}

%TODO: check for accuracy
Our transfer setup is the same as in Ref.~\cite{castellanos-gomezDeterministicTransferTwodimensional2014}, but upgraded with a heater stage capable of fast heating and cooling cycles between room temperature and \SI{150}{celsius}.
% 
We prepared the PPC solution by dissolving PPC at a \SI{15}{\percent} weight ratio in anisole at \SI{50}{\celsius}, while stirring with a fish magnet until everything was properly dissolved.
% 
Our assembly using PPC is based on Ref.~\cite{pizzoccheroHotPickupTechnique2016} with minor modifications adjusted to our transfer setup.
% 
For every pick-and-place step, we fixed the substrate from or to which to transfer the flakes with vacuum, and used a single glass slide with a bubble of PDMS covered with PPC.
%
Both glass slide and chip could be individually moved with micrometer screws.
%
The following steps describe our typical working process for achieving high-quality interfaces:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Align the top BN flake with the center area of the PDMS/PPC template.
	%
	Lower the glass slide such that the PPC touches the substrate.
	%
	Take care that the PPC does not yet cover the flake, but touches down less than \SI{100}{\micro\meter} away from it.
	%
	\item Increase the stage temperature above \SI{55}{\celsius}.
	%
	The PDMS/PPC will expand and cover the flake, and adhesion between BN and PPC increase significantly.
	%
	\item Turn off the stage heater and wait for the stage to cool below \SI{40}{\celsius} (possibly with the help of a nitrogen gun).
	%
	At this stage, the adhesion between BN and PPC should exceed that of BN and substrate.
	%
	Now lifting the glass slide should rip the flake off the substrate.
	%
	If at this stage the intended flake did not get picked up, repeating the process by heating to \SIrange{80}{90}{\celsius} and then cooling down should result in a much higher yield, at cost of longer waiting times for the stage to cool down.
	%
	\item Place the chip with the graphene flake on the stage and align the flake with the BN on the glass slide below now.
	%
	Slowly lower the glass slide and set the stage temperature to \SI{110}{\celsius}. 
	%
	The hot air and deflected slide will make it difficult to align the two flakes, so extra care has to be taken at this step.
	%
	Once the stage has reached \SI{110}{\celsius}, bring stage and glass slide in contact as slowly as possible until the interface passes the Gr and BN, preferably letting the expanding PDMS do the work.
	%
	\label{assembly-start}
	%
	\item Increase the stage temperature to \SI{120}{\celsius} and then retract the glass slide, thus delaminating the top BN on the graphene flake.
	%
	\label{flake-delam}
	\item Anneal the Gr/hBN stack at \SI{170}{\celsius} for \SI{15}{\minute}.
	%
	\item Place PPC/PDMS glass slide above the chip, turn off the stage heater and bring the polymer in contact once the temperature is below \SIrange{70}{80}{\celsius}.
	% 
	\item Once the temperature drops below \SI{40}{\celsius}, retract the glass slide.
	%
	The Gr/hBn stack should get lifted off the substrate.
	%
	\label{assembly-stop}
	%
	\item For assembling the BN-G-BN sandwich, repeat steps \ref{assembly-start} - \ref{assembly-stop}.
	%
	If needed, transfer the sandwich to another substrate.
\end{enumerate}

Another polymer commonly used for heterostructure assembly is PC.
%
Its advantage over PPC is that it is a much stronger adhesive, so the intermediate flake delamination (step \ref{flake-delam}) can be skipped.
%
However, it needs to be kept in a fridge in order to not degrade, and cannot be spin-coated on the PDMS layer.
%
Instead, a droplet of PC is placed on a \SI{20x20}{\milli\meter} glass coverslip.
%
A second coverslip is dropped on the first one, thus spreading the droplet in between.
%
With care, but in a swift motion, we pull the top glass piece off, thus leaving behind a thin film of PC on the bottom glass slide, which can be peeled off using a piece of tape and placed on the PDMS stamp.
%
For flake transfer, we follow the above steps, except that the transfer takes place at a base temperature of \SI{110}{\celsius} instead of \SI{40}{\celsius}, and to activate the adhesion to PC, heating to \SIrange{130}{140}{\celsius} instead of \SIrange{80}{90}{\celsius} is required.

\subsubsection{Challenges of heterostructure assembly}

Various challenges were encountered when integrating van der Waals heterostructures with RF circuits:
The polymer used for transfer (PC, PPC) has very strong adhesion to the metal areas of the shunts, ground planes and center conductors.
While during stack assembly on oxidized silicon, the polymer would only touch the substrate preliminary, when attempting to delaminate the heterostructure on the pre-patterned substrates, the polymer would rip off the PDMS carrier and also get delaminated, cf. Fig.~\ref{fig:fab-hetero-challenge}A.
Additionally, van der Waals crystals have strong adhesion to the metals used in our work, which resulted in a number of residual flakes on the final chip surrounding the intended heterostructure.
A long soak in NMP was able to remove the polymer at least visibly, but residual flakes had to be etched away in a separate step.

On the other hand, flake adhesion on the substrate itself was found to vary from good to extremely poor:
We found that BN-G-BN stacks would often get washed away due to unsufficient adhesion to sapphire substrates during processing.
Due to the low adhesion of BN to sapphire and silicon nitride, many stacks were washed off the final substrates when dissolving the polymer.
While the transfer yield of heterostructures on sapphire and silicon nitride was only as low as \SI{50}{\percent} and \SI{0}{\percent}, respectively, we did not observe this behaviour on silicon and silicon oxide (HSQ) surfaces, (cf. Fig.~\ref{fig:fab-hetero-challenge} (B)), where all delaminated flakes would stick.
Note that even adhesion promotion using HMDS did not improve the situation.

Finally, trapped dirt at the interfaces between BN and graphene

\subsubsection{Device patterning}

The graphene devices presented in this thesis consist of the BN-G-BN sandwich and G-Josephson junction, and the surrounding RF circuitry.
%
The RF circuits are patterned first on either large silicon chips, or \SI{2}{in} sapphire wafers.
%
In a second process flow, the vdW heterostructures are delaminated and contacts and top gates to the Josephson junctions are made.

We fabricate the graphene Josephson junctions using the etch-fill technique with top-gates, consisting of a combination of Ebeam lithography, reactive ion etching and sputter deposition, in the following fashion:

% 
In order to improve the adhesion between the electron beam resist and substrate, we coated the substrate with a monolayer of HMDS (hexamethyldisilazane, \ce{[(CH3)3Si]2NH}) from \textit{MicroChemicals} from the gas phase using the hotplate with integrated HMDS deposition system of a \textit{Suss MicroTec Delta 80 RC}, with prebaking at \SI{150}{\celsius} for \SI{6}{\minute}.
% 
We found that this immensely helped against under-etching of dielectrics with BOE, or even cracks in the resist after development of PMMA or CSAR, regardless of whether the substrate was metallic or dielectric.
