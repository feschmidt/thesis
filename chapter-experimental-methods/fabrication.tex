\subsection{The art of making encapsulated graphene devices}

Figure 1: Exfoliation of single flakes and sandwich assembly using the dry transfer method.
In the main text, also describe the PC+Chloroform method.
Huge hurdles during this project: Bad flake adhesion on sapphire, very good adhesion between metal ground planes and PPC.

Figure 2: (a) AFM and optical images of sandwiches, illustrating bubbles. (b) overlay with CAD (c) cross-section of final devices.
