\begin{abstract}
A significant, if not the major portion of an experimental physics thesis consists of the countless hours being spent on the (sometimes seemingless never ending) loop of device fabrication and device measurement.
% 
This chapter serves to give an insight into the methods and technique being used to assemble functioning devices, together with a few tips and tricks that might be of use to other experimenters.
% 
While the backbone of this thesis was the use of the Kavli Nanolab Delft cleanroom, one of the biggest academic cleanrooms on the European continent, and all measurement presented in this thesis were performed in state-of-the-art dry dilution refridgerators, the methods are nonetheless extendable to smaller-scale laboratories.
