This thesis would not have been possible without the help and encouraging words from many people.

\textbf{Gary}, you are a great motivator and always found the right words of encouragement when things were not going as planned, especially in the beginning of my PhD.
%
Your curiosity in many different fields of physics was what got me hooked to join your group.

Thank you also to \textbf{Anton}, my second promotor.
%
It was always very refreshing, and at times eye-opening, to get another PI's perspective on things not only scientifically, but especially on things at the work place.
%
I would also like to thank all members of the committee for feedback on and evaluating this dissertation.

First, to the members of SteeleLab:
%
\textbf{Mark}, my fellow graphene team guy!
%
We had a good whirl at the intricaties and challenges of merging DC bias cavities with graphene and boron nitride flakes.
%
It was a great moment when we saw the first graphene resonance, and a sad one when you left for the far north.
%
Let's keep the memes alive!
%
\textbf{Martijn}, thank you for teaching me sarcasm and saying no to my supervisor.
%
Sorry for not bringing back the bicycles, but then again you had the cleaning personnel take care of my samples.
%
Current events forbid me to nominate paranymphs, but rest assured I would have liked to return the favor.

Next up, my two fellow SteeleLab-solid state minority members:
%
\textbf{Nikos}, from the first time talking to you during my interview I knew that we would get along quite well.
%
Thank you for letting me crash on your couch on my first day of work, the good times in Boston, NYC and our office.
%
I wish you and your family all the best for the future.
%
Hello, Turkish lady!
%
\textbf{Yıldız}, you 

\textbf{Marios} AC/DC friend and great chats, during these crazy times, on all things PhD and family related.

\textbf{Mario} fellow coding nerd and great time in the USA.
%
A big thank you for teaching me the intricacies of circuit anharmonicties, and collaboration.

About one year after I had started, our lab suddenly more than doubled in size.
%
\textbf{Byoung-moo}, I'm glad you can finally harvest the crops of your super-ambitious project.
%
Good luck with finishing things up!
%
\textbf{Sarwan}, I enjoyed our obstacle runs together.
%
Keep mastering the membranes, workouts and cooking, and good luck onwards!
%
I know you have great support with \textbf{Adrián}, who introduced me to the (currently) best Pizza bakery in Delft.
%
Keep the flag of stlab(utils) flying!
%
\textbf{Daniel}, thank you for teaching me about microwave and superconducting physics, and the beautiful derivations you just keep coming.
%
Also thank you to the other half of the QOMSIM team, \textbf{Inês}!
%
I enjoyed our collaboration on the current detection, and I wish you two all the best for your future research.
%
Fingers crossed you keep up the success!
%
\textbf{Jasper}, you still have your entire PhD roller coaster ahead of you.
%
Hold on tight, and it shall be a good ride.

\textbf{Hadi}, it's nice to see that 2D materials in our group is still being held alive.
%
Best of luck with your current and future projects!
%
\textbf{Fatemeh}

I would also like to thank all Bachelor and Master students who I supervised, for showing me what it takes to improve my supervision skills:
%
In alphabetical order, \textbf{Artiom, Daniël, Eagan} and \textbf{Pieter}.

Over the years, I have made some great friends in other groups of the department of Quantum Nanoscience.
%
\textbf{Moritz}
%
Even though the second floor kept us apart, \textbf{Sabina} and \textbf{Maria}

In the cleanroom, I was privileged to get to interact with some great lithography experts:
\textbf{David} and \textbf{Ale}, thank you both for advise and chats on completely different topics, and sharing some of the best tips and tricks to increase the process quality.
%
The Kavli Nanolab cleanroom itself would not be standing without the following people:
\textbf{Frank, Marc, Eugene, Pauline, Ewan, Marco, Marco, Charles, Anja, Arnold, Hozanna, Ron, Roel} and \textbf{Lodi}, you not only keep things from blowing up, but also up and running, even though it sometimes is the Wild West in there.
%
It was an amazing experience to be able to work in probably one of the best equipped university cleanrooms worldwide.

I would like to extend a "heel erg bedankt" to the support staff of Quantum Nanoscience:
%
\textbf{Maria, Marijke, Etty, Erika} and \textbf{Heleen}, thank you for taking care of so many administrative requests, never freaking out about the messy receipts for reimbursements and the countless hours of solving Basware related quirks and bugs.
%
\textbf{Tino, Ronald} and \textbf{Tom}, you always kept things rolling and never got tired of our requests to building new setups or sample holders.
%
Thank you to the entire team at \textit{DEMO}, especially \textbf{Erik} and \textbf{Jack} for support in electrical matters and building the IVVI modules.

Thank you also to the great technicians at \textit{QuTech}, \textbf{Jason Raymond, Raymond} and \textbf{Marijn} for support regarding electronics, PCBs and filters
