\chapter{How to make copper-powder filters}
\label{app:copperpowder}

This is the detailed recipe we used to make our own copper-powder filters.
These filters usually consist of a long, meandering PCB (2m or so wire length) connectorized with SMA connectors, encased in a copper box. To suppress high-frequency radiation (>\SI{1}{\giga\hertz}), the box is then filled with the copper powder. Due to the chemical nature of this process, it is highly recommended to do all of this in a fumehood in a chemical lab, following standard laboratory procedures.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item \SI{200}{\gram} resin (\textit{hars})
		\item \SI{100}{\gram} hardener (\textit{harder})
	\end{itemize}
	\item \href{https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/aldrich/326453?lang=en&region=NL}{Copper powder from SigmaAldrich}
\end{itemize}

\section{Tools}
\begin{itemize}
	\item (TU Delft) paper coffee cup
	\item \href{https://www.lab-shop.co.uk/liquid-handling-4597/plastipak-sterile-disposable-syringes-4469/plastipak-300185-sterile-disposable-425054.htm}{BD Plastikpak 2ml syringe 300185}

	\item \href{http://www.cleancross.net/english/products/threeinch_slim.html#BB-001}{HUBY-340 cotton swabs}
	\item spatula
	\item scissors
	\item precision scale
\end{itemize}

\section{Instructions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Fill \SI{10}{\gram} resin into the TUDelft coffee cup
	\item Add \SI{5}{\gram} hardener
	\item Stir for a few minutes using the spatula. The mixture should be slightly yellow and clear. Bubbles are normal. It should be very liquid.
	\item Carefully, and in the fumehood add \SI{79.5}{\gram} copper powder. The total weight should read \SI{94.5}{\gram}
	\item Stir again for a few minutes, until there are no more visible grains, also in the edges of the cup. The mixture should look like quite viscous liquid Nutella.
	\item At this point it is safe to work outside of the fume hood
	\item Cut down the walls of the coffee cup using the scissors. This will make it easier to fill the syringe
	\item Fill the syringe from the cup. One syringe should be enough for one of our usual rectangular copper boxes
	\item Slowly squirt the mixture into the copper box. Be careful, as it should go very easy! Slightly overfill the box
	\item Put the lid on and press it onto the bottom piece
	\item Using the swab, clean off mixture that got through
	\item Leave the rest of the mixture with the syringe next to the copper powder filter box for about a day

	\item The next day, if the mixture inside the cup is solid, then it will also be solid inside the box because it is a chemical reaction that hardens the epoxy, not evaporation
\end{itemize}

\section{Testing the filter}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Measure the through resistance using a handheld multimeter. Typical through-resistance is around \SI{3}{\ohm}
	\item Measure the resistance center pin to ground, should be open
	\item Connect the filter to a VNA and measure the transmission using cryocompatible cables at RT
	\item Dunk the filter into liquid nitrogen and repeat the measurements repeatedly
	\item Note that when taking the filter back out of nitrogen, the inside might be shorted to ground because of air moisture. After one hour it should be back to normal again
\end{itemize}
