\section{Matplotlib colormaps for spyview}\label{app:spyview}
Spyview is a very useful piece of software for quick data visualization and exploration.
It does however come with only a limited set of outdated colormaps.
The following source code describes how to generate \texttt{.ppm} files based on the matplotlib colormaps that can be used for spyview:

\section{Ebeam height map visualization}

The Raith EBPGs have the capability to record the height of the chip before exposure by measuring the angular reflection of a laser beam off the chip surface.

The following is a python file to extract this data from the log files in a user folder on either one of the TU Delft EBPGs, and plot these height maps as single pngs.
